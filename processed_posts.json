And there\u2019s so many errors I have to go through and fix manually, because doing it with voice control is too difficult.

Pain doesn't discriminate and I know it sucks,but you can't just blow up on everyone.\"  she was still a jerk too everyone, but a little less of a jerk to me.At the time I was 24 when I had back surgery.  I'm 31 now and I still get that. Having had this injury for almost half my life now, is what makes me value what I do and it means a lot to patients that I actually DO understand what they're going through.

Afterall I was young, a reasonably healthy weight, and little did she know... an invisible illness.Of course I just sat on the floor after that. She never looked at me to wonder why I wasn't standing and nobody stood up for me for being treated so poorly and singled out on the train.It's always stuck with me and made me afraid to ask for a seat on public transport. Nobody would ever offer me one at 25, even though I often sit on the dirty floor to ensure I can be seated.I'm working on my confidence to be able to ask for a seat!",

        "text": "I'll give you some useful tools that have worked for me.Infrared sauna and red light therapy: both of these have helped a lot with chronic pain especially in the neck, back area, wrists, and feet. Especially in your case this could be something that could drastically benefit you. I noticed that once I started using it In less than a week I noticed massive difference. First I started going to the gym using their infrared sauna. And then later went on Amazon and bought myself and infrared sauna. It's definitely worth it especially if The pain is constant everyday. The red light therapy device i got from redlightman online. if you do plan on using the redlight use some kind of cbd topical with it. Helps ALOTTTT MORE with healing!!! The red light helps the CBD penetrate deeper with the vasodilation and absorption. Can't recommend it enough.Redlight device from: (Redlightman)Ginger extract with bromelain: both of these compounds have a systemic effect on lowering inflammation and is very similar to curcumin which is the main compound found in turmeric. I noticed that my baseline pain is a lot lower now ever since I started supplementing both. I like the brand nutricost and bulk supplements which you can find on Amazon. They have great productsCBD topical and CBD tincture: I noticed that ever since I started using CBD topically and some CBD internally that this has done a drastic shift and helping me deal with pain. I take a CBD pain relief gel topical on my areas of inflammation and pain. And then I take a CBD tincture internally and this helps with systemic inflammation. This combination is truly remarkable. If you do go for the CBD pain relief gel get either the 3000mg or 5,000 mg it's definitely worth it and it lasts you over 3 months. I would say this for sure is my top three go to's for when I'm in pain. Which is almost always lolHighly recommend this combination. The muscle CBD pain relief Gel is from Herbal Garden Essentials . And the CBD tincture I get from Charlotte's Web. I like Charlotte's Web a lot just because they pretty much started the whole CBD movement in Colorado.Last thing I would recommend which is relatively new and it's form for dealing with chronic pain is ketamine therapy. I have used this company called joyous And I use their lozenges That dissolve in your mouth. It's a microdose and it drastically has helped with my mental health and as well chronic pain.Definitely look into the sauna and CBD topical/ Tincture Those two have been a miracle for me. helping take care of the inflammation with the cbd daily can help with healing and recovering.Hope this helps and gives you some kind of direction",

        "text": "Can you get in touch with your old doctor? Maybe they can suggest someone that has actually prescribed an opioid or two in their medical career. They should know not to do this to any patient.I wished there was a bit more notice than a week.The first thing you should do is relax. Have you ever had opioid withdrawal before? Even a little taste? Theres some ways around some of the worst of it. Taper is a big deal so if it looks imminent (with a week it sorta does, just being honest), you may want to break up some pills (make sure its safe, some drugs you cant). A little taper can go a long way.With your heart issues, all these doctors are nuts. Use the ER if you have to, I figure you probably have some sort of monitor app on your watch/phon, if not better monitoring. I wouldnt hesitate.The pain meds youre on are going to matter a lot and doses, etc and so on will determine how severe this will be. I wouldn't ask you to post your drug regemin or location. Maybe Ill drop you a PM too. But it sounds like youve run in to a lot of cracked doctors. Its not you.This doc that said you would have a heart attack? Your cardiologist? Im sure they have a fully functioning DEA prescribing number. Perhaps if you told their nurse and explained what the doctor told you... they might get in trouble, whoever they are, if you have something go awry. They should see it makes much more sense to Rx the needed medications...I wouldnt suggest long use, as there might be a heavy metal issue with it, but are you familiar with the Indonesian herb Kratom? Its a legal opioid at least for the time being, and the legality can vary with your location. But if its a \"break glass in case of emergency\" moment, you might want to explore it. You should be able to detox pretty easily with it. Addicts use it a lot for that purpose. And others.But I think my first step would be trying to contact your old doc. I dont need to go through to whole history of the \"Opioid Crisis\", but there are lots of doctors who know this whole Rx thing is bullshit, its just cover up for the DEA and the \"wonderful\"/s job they have done with street drugs. More deadly than ever, but who's noticed with all the bullshit they put out about RX drugs? Exactly as planned. And paid for. Some people, including doctors, have actually followed the numbers and the money know this Rx opioid garbage is made up. You need to find one of those doctors. Theyre out there. I dont think I'd call 4 docs an extensive search, you can only work with what you have, but maybe widen the area. And try different specialists. Try Anesthesiologists, they do pain sometimes, Try PM&R practices. I find it an insulting term, but they call patients on long term opioid therapy \"legacy patients\". We are a legacy of the opioid crisis, instead of a legacy of the few years during which they actually knew how to treat pain. Either way its insulting.Dont give up looking. Youve seen a primary care and the 3 Stooges. Somewhere along the line, you have to run in to a doctor thats actually read the CDC's opioid prescribing guidelines....Hang in there...",

    "content": "My father has multiple sclerosis and is undergoing disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). He\u2019s been prescribed opioids for chronic pain but refuses to use them. After purchasing cannabis oil (CBD/THC), he decided against using it, worried it might interfere with his MS treatment and lead to complications like brain infections.He\u2019s not willing to consult his doctors, believing any interference\u2014no matter how minor\u2014could jeopardize his treatment. Based on my research, cannabis oil may affect liver enzymes and alter how MS medications are metabolized, potentially reducing their effectiveness.His doctors have prescribed opioids and other strong treatments, suggesting they\u2019re comfortable with potent interventions. This makes cannabis oil appear relatively low-risk from a medical standpoint, though its effects on the nervous system, absorption, and possible drug interactions remain uncertain. I\u2019m continuing to look into it, aiming to better understand its potential benefits and risks, particularly since he\u2019s still young at 53 and has a long life ahead of him.",

If the word hoax doesnt fit better than \"Crisis\", watch it again....And you should trim the front end of the video, Red. I don have suggestion/question if your dont mind? There seems to be an issue where these anti opioid zealots would listen to your evidence and say : \"Yeah, now we dont have any over prescribing of medication, but what about 20 years ago when this all started, doctors RX'ed opioids like candy\" We both know thats crap. It just seems to me that its important, either now or eventually, to expose this all as a plot to get the publics mind off the miserable failure of the DEA in preventing illicit fentanyl poisoning of street drugs across the board.Maybe Im jumping the gun, if you have to explain addiction and dependence to doctors... But it does seem they like to play past and present statistics against each other even when they have nothing but rhetoric as evidence.Well said, as always, Red. This should be a CME course for doctors on telling the difference between addiction and complaint pain patients, treating medical conditions. It shouldnt be necessary.My fear is the CDC and their pals have drained all compassion from medical profession. Its not going to be enough to prove them wrong, you have to make doctors care about relieving pain and suffering again, and I dont know if thats possible. Proving that this whole thing is full of beans, has never been the problem. That was a great inclusion of the AMA opioid policy, betcha that'll shock a lot of people...",

I think the conversation needs to go beyond the statistics to address more effective preventative measures and proactive intervention. Our healthcare system does not screen for addiction risk factors, does not empower patients to be aware of early signs of addiction, and treats addicts so poorly that most would never trust a doctor to help them recover. Our mechanisms to cope with the addicted population are so poor that we project the worst outcome onto everyone. Do you think that would happen if addiction had an effective protocol and cure? The tools exist to counteract addiction, but they occupy the fringes of medicine, casting people out to addiction centers instead of intervening in an earlier stage. Until our response to addiction is addressed, I doubt that statistics will matter much.",

    "content": "To recap, there's been an issue with my urine drug tests the last 2 times(Aug and Nov) I took my meds as I always had, but 1 test(aug) was missing oxycodone. Then next test(nov), it was missing morphine.I was FREAKING out because I have no explanation and I thought they were gunna kick me out.I was determined to make sure my meds show up. So I made sure to take my morphine 3 hours before the appointment and oxycodone 4 and then 2 hours before the appt. I've been so nervous  about this most recent test done on 12/18. I just got the results back.All of my meds showed up!!! There was 1 other variable. I drink an insane amount of lemonade/apple juice mixed. After those 2 off test, I started think maybe something about the acidity was throwing off my levels. So I made sure that I was only drinking water 3 days before the test. Because in my mind: lemonade=fail water=pass. Of course that could also have absolutely nothing to do with it.I'm just so relieved that I could cry. I know this whole thing has been quite the saga so I wanted to update you guys. And thank you for all your advice.I'm all ears if someone has any clue why this happened. And I can absolutely tell you, it was not because I wasn't taking it.ETA- I posted my results in the comments",

Apple juice is less potent than apple cider vinegar. Apple juice is fresh apple liquid. Apple cider vinegar is that liquid fermented more (more acid). Lemon is acid. So yeah, mixing apple juice and lemonade and drinking a ton every day could have caused your previous results. You can find recipes for apple lemon based detox drinks online with lots of claims about it. Your dr will probably disagree about it being the cause though.",

When I looked at my notes, I'd shown methadone in a blood test. At the time I was only taking Palexia SR and paracetamol.I asked my GP if anything I was on could have metabolised into methadone and was told no. She also said no anaesthesia would have shown as methadone. I went down a few rabbit holes and discovered methadone is virtually never given in operations. The only possible operation to use it is a complex spinal operation where you need to be conscious but in as little pain as possible.I've never had to do tests for Pain Clinic, and that blood result made me quite worried. I'm in Australia if that helps, and the day surgery was to \"collect\" a stray gall stone that was threatening to block my pancreas.Afaik I wasn't given additional opioids during the hospital visit. There would have been no need.",

Fast forward to the last couple weeks, pain is back to where it was. My doc said we could raise the dose or lower it since I have some side effects. But, I am also kind of out of pain options since I tried gabapentin, physical injections, amitriptyline, protriptyline, etc. I have my medical marijuana card and I use that and it marginally helps. It at least helps me fall asleep.With that in mind do I try to lower or raise the dose?",

        "text": "DEA Rule Extension...that might as well have been titled be 'Replacing Oxycodone with Aspirin For Their Own Good Law' for procedural non-differenceLinked aboved is a recent ruling made by the DEA jointly with HHS. I like it. I even posted about it the other day, in support of a different topic. I'm doing that again, in yet another context.What is in the post-title link is part of the DEA's (in this case) rule-making (amending/extending,etc. process) where the  public is invited to peruse  the rule and other details. (Example is in post link.) After that, readers are meant to move on to the public comments section where they are encouraged to write  in their opinions, for example.While there on the main page, looking over at the side bar I notice their tally for number of times read; it had been read  \"0\" (zero) times.Well 'that has to' stop. By that I mean we need to start taking responsibilty for ourselves before we can expect anyone else to follow. We know now that this is a thing, so we need to stay alert for opportunities such as this. I'm not saying nobody does already, but clearly a lot don't participate in saying their piece, where and to whom it matters:*when it might affect policy.*And policy is not our friend lately.Having gotten dv'd already, I'm going to stop right here. I didn't know how best to make a long comment to a post before the post  existed, except like this. Maybe somebody will get my drift. I hope so. I'm just about back-of-an-ambulette material anyway.

I can take a pain pill and it brings the pain down about 50% but it doesn't last very long. I feel like crying everyday. I have an appointment coming up for a physical with a doctor I've never seen before and I'm going to request an x-ray of my left hip because something is definitely wrong. It's not the same pain I have every day it's worse. I can't walk it hurts to bend sitting is a challenge standing up straight is a challenge it's just horrible. I would wait until I see the pain doctor next however he will just say oh let me do an injection. I don't want an injection I want to know what's wrong with my hip. He thought he was going to help my lower back pain by injecting three nerves on each side between my vertebrates on my lower back. Each injection sent excruciating pain to pain spot I have. I was in worst pain than when I went in and then it took like 7 days to be back to my normal pain. I'm at my wit's end with the pain and it doesn't help my anxiety when my anxiety is up my pain is worse when my pain is up my anxiety is worse it's a no win situation.  I am severely depressed most of the time. I can't do the stuff I used to be able to do number one is work I loved my job and I had to go on disability.",

What I just can't understand is why nothing works absolutely nothing is there anybody out there in the same situation where nothing works. I've had two spinal epidurals, spinal nerve block, two nerve blocks in the occipital muscle, botox, I have tried every pain medication every single one and more and nothing works two days ago I had to go to the ER yet again for pain they gave me two rounds of IV morphine did nothing! The last time they admitted me for pain they did the morphine, they did dilauded, and nothing worked! I just don't get it is there anybody that is in this situation I mean I can't leave my house for 3 years now from pain. If I hear one more time you have a choice you can sit in the house for all these years or you can get out to visit. Are you kidding me I can't even open my eyes my pain is so bad. I am sick of hearing you have a choice because I don't have a choice. It's just 24/7 7 days a week 365 days a year no thing is up and down pain when it was a two it was a two and then it became four eight now I describe it to the doctors as 10:10 Plus don't know if there is such a thing.

Tbf they went and checked all cardiac stuff after begging and seeing private cardio\u2019s. Yeah nothing wrong other than a myocardial bridge. But neurology, rheumatology surley need to be looked at and an actual endo to help with my hashis because my TSH goes like 3-7-11-4-5 like I\u2019m in so much pain and fatigue. My folate is 1.1, low vit D, B12 lowish.I\u2019m trying and just get sent home with paracetamol, can\u2019t even have ibuprofen as I\u2019m allergic.Just really hate this.",

This man was amazing. He listened. He had to examine me and I am still in terrible pain from an infract of the omentum. He looked at me and said, \"did they tell you what caused it.\" I told him they said it was the weight loss. He shook his head and said, \"I don't like that!\" He thinks that I have a rare condition on top of a rare condition. I am apparently a fucking unicorn. He looked at me, asked if I minded if he ran a bunch of tests and told me he wants to figure this out and give me some answers. That is the second doctor to not like the ER explanation. I am seeing my surgeon in a few hours. I get to explain the pain is terrible and I haven't slept. I am not looking forward to it.",

    "content": "Hello friends,Over the past few months I\u2019ve been dealing with on/off neck pain. It typically impacts the base of my neck. At its worst, it can be difficult to even walk around. I\u2019m constantly adjusting my position to get comfortable.I did an X Ray a few weeks ago and the orthopedic said all looks good from a bone perspective. An MRI is next.While I wait for that to get some more conclusive results, does anyone have any advice on what I can do to alleviate the pain? I\u2019m currently doing a ton of heat pad therapy, massage gun and stretches.",

You might also want to try gentle neck exercises to improve flexibility and strength, as strengthening the muscles around your neck could reduce pain.Keeping good posture throughout the day, especially if you're sitting for long periods, is also important. If the pain persists or worsens, you may want to consider seeking expert care from specialists likeLancaster Orthopaedicsto get a more tailored treatment plan.",

    "content": "My mom had surgery this past Monday, and when her surgeon came to talk to her pre-op, she was very nice and had an excellent bedside manner. All the nurses kept telling us that she was not only super nice but an excellent surgeon. I asked her how my mom\u2019s pain would be handled post-op. She immediately stood up from her chair and snapped at me that \u201cshe couldn\u2019t answer that yet\u201d. I was very taken about by her abrupt turn about. She then told me very condescendingly that \u201c50% of her patients are able to go home and do just fine with Tylenol and Ibuprofen\u201d. I didn\u2019t want to piss her off any more, but had to ask her what did the other 50% do. She repeated that she would decide, told my mom she\u2019d see her in OR soon, and left. When surgery was over and she came out to talk with me I again asked about pain control. She told me the whole \u201c50% of my patients\u201d BS again. This time I pushed back. Told her I was there as my mother\u2019s advocate and would not put her in a position where OTC meds weren\u2019t helping. I asked her what we were supposed to do if a situation presented itself at 1am where the OTC meds weren\u2019t helping? She stared at me, sighed, and agreed to send over an Rx. I\u2019m telling you, the master plan of the government is to eventually have opioid prohibition.",

As someone with spinal stenosis and DDD, it wasn\u2019t the worst pain I\u2019ve been in but I still definitely needed opiates the first few days. They won\u2019t give even 2-3 days worth of opiates to people who just had surgery to remove an organ.

        "text": "yes you're right the master plan is to eventually have opioid prohibition and that is exactly why it is important for us in pain and dependent on opiates to fight back and be heard. I understand that some people have died from opiate overdose and I'm sympathetic to these families, but people have died from alcohol every day and its legal. people die from cigarettes and they're legal. people die driving automobiles and they're legal. So the answer to those people who face addiction is easy access to treatment for those who seek it NOT opiate prohibition. When you make opiates illegal or hard to obtain it does not erase addiction that exists and will always exist.. and it only empowers cartels and illegal drug sales.. so maybe that's it .. maybe some of the politicians are in bed with the cartels who would love opiate prohibition.. Or maybe some of the pharmaceutical companies and their investors in non opiate pain medications are trying to demonize opitates so they can push their garbage non working pain meds and make more money.. (because nothing compares to opiates for pain)I had a major surgery last year where I was cut open from the top of my abdomen to the bottom of my abdomen (and I'm a tiny woman so the nerve damage and scar tissue alone is unbearable) but I also had a bowel resection and biopsy of my uterus at the same time, and emergency hernia repair where they stitched my muscles together in the abdomen (they didn't use mesh because i get ascites) .. Anyway they had me on IV Dilaudid for the first 6 days in the hospital (half gram every 2 hours because 1 gram was too much and that would have been 1 gram every 4 hours but since I asked for half gram instead they let me have it every 2 hours) And luckily that protocol was effective for my pain.. but If i hadn't had a tube in my stomach for 6 days they wouldn't have given me iv drugs like that i'm sure.. because once they took the tube out on day 6 they switched me to 5 mg oxycodone every 4 hours.. Then they released me on the 10th day in the hospital and sent me with only 14 oxycodone 5 mgs, then the surgeons refilled that for me the next week, and by the 3rd and 4th weeks they were already giving me a hard time when asking for refills and started cutting it down to only 7 pills for a week.. Saying that it's already been nearly a month.. as if I should magically be pain free because it's been nearly a month.. It's been a year and I'm still not pain free from that surgery. One doctor even told me the nerve pain alone could last 15 months.. Anyway, thank god I have a good doctor who has me on 120  5 mg oxycodone a month and that has literally saved my life and given me my life back from over 25 years of chronic pain from before I even had the surgery.. Not to mention the giant tumor on my uterus and all that pain.. I wouldn't be able to be present for my children without these medicines. Opiates are a miracle for many of us and I hope that we can advocate for ourselves and be heard.. we need to be louder than the people who are trying to prohibit them.",

Because of this I take pain relief, but, as everyone is talking about, there has been something happen to the Dr community and they very quickly label people, and one bad dr can have their label stick and that's it for the patient. The ambulance drivers in my local area have an alert to not give pain relief if I have another break (which happens a lot) and to just make me deal with it because, and I quote, patient may have had one dose already that day.It's gone beyond anything logical to not help people in pain. The fear of addicts taking advantage of the system has stopped all people receiving adequate care and now chronic pain patients are paying the price. I don't think these systems have helped any addicts at all, just stopped genuine people be treated with compassion",

        "text": "(Rest of article\u2014 cause exclusive to subscription)The company said in a press release that it believes addressing variability among responses in placebo patients by better designing its clinical trials could allow suzetrigine to succeed in a future Phase 3 study.Researchers gave suzetrigine to 102 patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy (LSR), a condition in which compressed nerves in the spine lead to back and leg pain. The main goal of the study was reducing those patients\u2019 pain as measured by the numeric pain rating scale, which asks patients to rank pain from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the worst pain imaginable).Those patients saw their pain reduced by an average of 2.02 points. By that measure the study was a success. But Vertex also enrolled a group of 100 patients who received placebo. Those patients reported a 1.98-point pain reduction from baseline, which is statistically no different from the results in the patients who received the drug.Investors appeared disappointed by the results. In premarket trading, Vertex shares dropped almost 13%. Paul Matteis, an analyst at Stifel, called the results \u201ca pretty clear negative,\u201d noting that the drug and placebo both improved pain scores by about two points. He said that \u201coverall, we\u2019re confused\u201d by the decision to move the drug into a Phase 3 trial, which Vertex said it plans to launch pending conversations with regulators. The results of the Phase 3 would need to be positive and large enough to lead to the drug\u2019s approval. But that trial would be expected to compare the drug directly to placebo, not to patients\u2019 pain scores at the beginning of the study.Vertex said an after-the-fact analysis of its study results showed that the response to placebo was highly variable among different research sites. In the 40% of study sites that had lower placebo response, the suzetrigine pain reduction remained the same. The company said that \u201ctrial design innovation may better control the placebo response.\u201dAn inflated placebo response that can make effective treatments seem ineffective is a known issue that has dogged studies in depression, pain, and other indications that rely on patient surveys. One problem can be that patients and doctors rate pain worse in order to get into a study, and then return to rating their pain at a lower level when there has not been real improvement. Steps that ask for neutral ratings or follow patients before they start taking medicines can mitigate this effect, but there is no guarantee it will make a drug that did not distinguish itself from placebo appear effective.Analysts had largely expected that suzetrigine might not be statistically better than placebo. In an Oct. 7 note to investors, analysts at Leerink Partners led by David Risinger noted that trials of anticonvulsants had often failed to beat placebo. But the Leerink analysts wrote that they hoped the drug would at least be \u201cnumerically\u201d better than placebo \u2014 something that was barely true.\u201cSuzetrigine has again demonstrated its potential to fill an important unmet need in the treatment of pain,\u201d Carmen Bozic, Vertex\u2019s chief medical officer, said in a statement.In the lead-up to Thursday\u2019s announcement, market analysts had framed the trial results as a major moment for the company\u2019s stock, and for the millions of people who struggle with uncontrolled chronic pain. More than 4 million people a year deal with lumbosacral radiculopathy, also known as sciatica. The condition is a form of chronic pain triggered when nerve roots in the spine become compressed or irritated. That can lead to pain down the lower back and through the legs that in severe cases makes it nearly impossible to move. Current remedies, including ibuprofen, opioids, physical therapy, and rest, often come up short.RELATEDVertex\u2019s drug is a small molecule that targets NaV1.8, a protein that sits on the surface of neurons and regulates the flow of sodium ions into these cells, which in turn controls the electrical signals neurons send. So-called sodium channels are expressed throughout the nervous system, but NaV1.8 is one of a few channels expressed in pain-sensing neurons and virtually nowhere else. That has made the protein a prized target for drug developers looking to quell pain without side effects such as addiction or slowed breathing and heart rate. But precisely targeting sodium channels has been easier said than done. Biogen, Roche, Amgen, and Pfizer have all launched and scrapped programs in the space. Vertex\u2019s own executives have called the pain field a graveyard for drug development, and on three occasions the company took promising NaV1.8 inhibitors into clinical trials before abandoning them. The biotech is convinced, however, that it can succeed where others have failed. Vertex\u00a0announced\u00a0in January that suzetrigine, formerly known as VX-548, safely reduced pain in a pair of late-stage trials of patients who\u2019d gotten a tummy tuck or bunion surgery. While expertsdescribed the findings\u00a0as modest, the biotech has filed for Food and Administration approval to use the drug to treat moderate to severe acute pain, for which 80 million people in the U.S. seek treatment each year. It\u2019s expecting an FDA decision by Jan. 30.Some market analysts have projected sales as high as $5 billion in acute pain, but there\u2019s a larger potential market for chronic pain. Sell-side research firm Wolfe Research has modeled peak annual revenue of $11 billion for peripheral neuropathic pain, a type of lingering pain involving nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. Last year, Vertex reported mid-stage\u00a0results\u00a0showing that suzetrigine reduced chronic nerve pain in patients with diabetes, and the biotech plans to confirm those findings in a late-stage study. After years of industry stumbles, biotech companies are increasingly looking to develop their own non-addictive pain therapies to compete with Vertex.\u00a0AxonisTherapeutics and\u00a0Latigo\u00a0Biotherapeutics both announced financing mega-rounds this year to fund such efforts. And SiteOne Therapeutics, a Bay Area biotech that has a partnership with Vertex, announced a $100 million Series C round on Wednesday to support development of inhibitors of NaV1.8 and NaV1.7, a closely related sodium channel.",

This last therapist I saw said it was a nerve issue. Kinda made sense considering when I get massages, certain areas like my rotators produce extreme pain with barely any pressure.Now, grain of salt time, the massage therapist is also a chiropractor, \"natural medicine\" practitioner, and a few other woo woo bullshit practices, so maybe he's just a quack.Is anyone familiar with any nerve conditions that could be causing this?",

    "content": "Botox in my neck and face really helped with the oromandibular and cervical torticollis!  Since my last post I took another turn into stupid land-my body is still falling apart.I used to have extreme range of motion in my shoulders. Scoliosis age and and old injuries to one shoulder meant lowered range of motion with on and off again subluxing. it was was stuck for some weeks and then popped back in about a week ago.Frickin rad, my shoulder worked again yay! It felt so good. I had so much to catch up on.... Of course I go back to my desired routines with gusto.Everything was good for few days and so I tried to carry a 40lb bag of cat litter. Later struggled to open a jar and used my arm as a brace along with the blue grippy tape.Then felt a skipping tendon and a pop in my shoulder while shaking out a towel followed by reduced motion and pain. ok, gotta slow down...So I bring it up at physical therapy this week as my arm shoulder and pec/back muscles were super constricted, arm won't straighten, hands go numb. We work on that, see if we can release some muscles that are rolling my shoulder forward.  All of a sudden my leg flops and my low back spasms, my shoulder pops and then feels a little more relaxed. hmm. PT time's up. it isn't perfect but a little better maybe. I agree to keep working on it, doing my exercises.Smarty pants here does an accidental juggling act on a step stool while grabbing an appliance stored above the kitchen cabinets that evening...Now two days later, I'm pretty sure I've at least partially torn my rotator cuff and the muscles are spasming on either side to stabilize my arm.I really don't want to go to the hospital, will end up with covid, norovirus, or some damn thing. I absolutely detest urgent care and ERs.  But can I wait 3 weeks for a normal doctor appointment? argh. I'll try to take it easy for the weekend I guess. it'll leave me overloaded and stressed entering into the work week. can I even take time off for this? the guilt and shame....why am I not dealing with it now? Is it really urgent if I'm not dying? omfg.....Rinse repeat and this is my life every month as my body falls further and further apart. Sigh...Fuck this timeline where my body betrays me so.  This is a viscous cycle.",

I have noticed that if I try and reduce the olanzapine my pain is worse. I also have co-codomol for pain and I have to use more of that.I wondered if the olanzapine was helping my pain levels, so I found this online. I wondered if it might help anyone else or if anyone else had used it for pain?https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392401003025#:~:text=With%20olanzapine%2C%20both%20patients%20reported,reversed%20when%20olanzapine%20was%20reintroduced.",

I feel so unheard and feel like I\u2019m bothering my doctor by going to them but I need to keep pushing, also no one around me really takes this seriously. I\u2019m 24 so they keep saying there\u2019s no way I have autoimmune or something like that which is more stressful because I have no clue what the hell is wrong with me! My main symptoms are joint pain, randomly, different areas. My worst is my back, it\u2019s like a burning pain and feels quite stiff - I\u2019ve had a mri on it which showed nothing just slight kyphosis. Had a chest xray it was all clear. I just don\u2019t feel right, can someone relate?Idk how to manage this, it\u2019s soooo tiring. I just want to feel normal again:(",

Because they didn\u2019t notice I had a hernia.Honestly I used to be so positive, as an osteopath helped 1000s of people in pain. Was on my way to being in the uk commonwealth team for wrestling. Was good at mma, Olympic weightlifting etc\u2026.

    "content": "PSA: get your uric acid levels checked.Gout is an under diagnosed condition. Both gout and other conditions can be confused for each other.High uric acid levels can cause uric acid crystals to slowly deposit in the joints over the months and years. But the deposits can also be in other areas of the body, NOT just joints. As there are 360 joints in the human body there are a lot of opportunities for these deposits to collect in various places for those who have high uric acid levels.20% of Americans have high uric acid.A gout flare is an excruciatingly painful condition when it is acute and it can become chronically painful when it is not treated. I know of several on ther/goutsubreddit forum that thought they just had random injuries but the underlying cause was found to be gout. Once you\u2019ve had one gout flare, recurrent flares become more probable and the condition can become chronic.The prognosis and treatment is very good. There are well tolerated uric acid lowering medications that when taken will slowly melt the uric acid crystals- this may take months or even years depending how long the condition has been untreated. One can get more flares as one starts the medicine but this is counter acted with anti-inflammatory medicine until the uric acid crystals are fully gone and don\u2019t cause any more flares.Here is a great thread about the condition:https://www.reddit.com/r/gout/s/4antVP9wVhI am just making this post to help some of you as I believe that nothing in this world is without a solution and I hope this helps some of you!",

It's a trauma and it throws the entire holistic system out of whack.After I had my daughter I started having migraines that increased in frequency and duration until one year later they were chronic (over 20 a month, most last for several days but some last for weeks).More women than men have migraines. More women who have had children have migraines. Estrogen and hormone fluctuations are a migraine trigger. Insurance won't pay for the hormone testing.So for the last 8 years I've been on every migraine treatment there is with no relief. We recently moved across the country to try and get better healthcare. And the deductible starts again in a couple weeks. I hate our healthcare system.",

Today was one of those days.Without a fail in the world I somehow managed to hurt myself even more after having such a good day.I stood up off our mattress that's on the floor and apparently stood ontop of a blanket. The blanket slid which in turn caused me to fall and I fell HARD. Landed directly on my wrist, my hand was bent in a weird way when I fell so I didn't land on my palm, not that that probably would've even mattered tbh. I'm a heavy person too, like really heavy. My arm was underneath my body so ontop of falling full force on my wrist I also had 300+ pounds on top of it.So yeah. I hate good days. Somehow I always end up getting hurt during them and then have to deal with more pain ontop of my daily pain.I'm gonna wait it out and see if it still hurts tomorrow then decide if I need to make a trip to the ER for X-rays.Update: got the X-rays and surprisingly it's not fractured or broken. I just sprained it really badly. Even the nurse was surprised when I told her how badly the fall was and it was only a sprain.",

        "text": "This sounds like a messy situation. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s legal for your landlord to enter your space without your knowledge or permission outside an emergency situation, and that would make me feel unsafe. Have you spoken with him to ask if he was in your room? You definitely need to file a report, even if you cannot name the person you believe stole the medication.Because of the nature of pain not typically being life-threatening and most prescribers having us sign contracts that address these situations as being our responsibility, I would not count on them being able to send in a new prescription, but if you\u2019ve been in compliance up until this point, they might be willing to work with you since your medication was technically in a place where you thought it was secure. If you could really die without the medication, then they will know that and react accordingly, but for better or for worse, the reality is that for people with most chronic pain conditions, going without pain medication is unlikely to be life-threatening, despite how much it may feel like it is.There\u2019s no easy or guaranteed solution in this situation, but if I were you, I would file the report ASAP if you haven\u2019t already, then contact my doctor and share a copy of the report and ask them how I can ensure I\u2019m still able to receive treatment for XYZ pain conditions until my next refill. It\u2019s Sunday, so that hurts your case because there\u2019s no one in the office and you\u2019ll likely have to speak to someone who\u2019s on call and not your normal doctor. I\u2019m not sure the best way to handle that, because if you wait, it makes it seem less urgent, but if you call now, you\u2019re unlikely to reach someone helpful. A portal message sent today might be the best compromise if that\u2019s an option, and then a call to follow up during office hours tomorrow.In a message to them today, I might say:\u201cHi, I hope you are well. I am in a difficult situation and am hoping you will be able to help. Over the weekend, my pain medication was stolen from my locked room. I have reason to believe that my landlord, with whom I have an ongoing dispute over accommodations, entered my room without permission and stole my remaining medication. I have filed a police report, a copy of which is attached to this message.This medication is critical for managing my pain, and I am concerned about going without it until my next refill, which is due on [date]. Could you please advise me on how to proceed? I understand there are policies in place for these types of situations, but given I believed my medication was secure in my locked room and that this is the first time I\u2019ve requested an early refill, is there a chance you may be able to make an exception so that I don\u2019t have to go without treatment for [condition] during this time? I greatly appreciate any guidance or assistance you\u2019re able to provide. I do feel this situation is urgent, and I will follow up with a call during office hours tomorrow.Thank you so much for your understanding, [Name]\u201dGood luck!",

Every year, it never fails, there\u2019salwaysa delay/shortage.Anyone else getting pharmacy notifications saying their meds due three days ago are on order and expected to arrive in the middle of next week?Luckily one of my two came in today, but I\u2019m holding out hope my other med (oxycodone) arrives tomorrow since Friday The 13th is my lucky day. I\u2019m going to pick up the other one tomorrow either way and it\u2019ll somewhat stave off withdrawals but\u2026This weekend is gonnasuuuuuuuuuckotherwise.Best advice I can give (that I can\u2019t do because my doctor is swamped and I don\u2019t want to come off as some addict screaming \"I NEEED MY DRUGS!\u201d) if you\u2019re in the same boat - If there\u2019s a small Mom and Pop pharmacy near you, call and ask them if they have your meds in stock and see if you can get the Rx transferred there if they do. In my experience, they\u2019re more likely to speak to you and, unlike chain pharmacies will do partial fills without a second prescriptionHope everyone else is going to be pain free for the holidays!",

    "content": "Hey guys im male 23yrs old, and I've been out of work for 7 months now because I was let go from my old job for not being well enough to perform all the physical parts of the job. I'm still seeing specialists to figure out what I got, and we've ruled out normal stuff and any rheumatological reasons but don't have a clue other than sending me to a chronic pain specialist (im still waiting to see them). Doctors said they don't believe it's lupus (which runs in my family) but that's all I've gotten. X rays are clean.my symptoms are: Muscle weakness/soreness Fatigue Joint pain Brain fog Occasional dizziness Occasional shortness of breath Tenderness and pain around ribs(no visible bruising) Strong flushing (has happened only a couple times) Headaches/migraines High sedimentation rate of blood samples Elevated liver enzymes (i rarely drink alcohol)First hospital visit had very very low potassium levels and normal magnesium.I've tried yoga, stretches, diet change, crochet, and the doctor prescribed me muscle relaxers, anti-anxietals as well as suggesting adding vitamin d supplements to my existing multivitamin intake. I'm still trying to figure things out, and it takes months to be seen by any specialists where I live. I've started using small amounts of thc to help deal with pain and my doctors are aware of that and gave me the ok to do so. Do you guys have any tips or methods you guys use to manage pain?",

You can always dm me if you need to vent. Their is a light at the end of the tunnel, you need to fight for it, ask for a CT or a MRI that can rule out alot also try and get a Ultrasound. The mri was the thing that solved the mystery. But just so you know if you do and they say you are fine don't stop fighting. You are not a burden and your pain is real, also I recommend a therapist just so you can talk it out. I honestly needed a therapist when I was suffering the most.",

You can ask your parents for maybe NyQuil or a similar one that has Tylenol in it. Maybe I\u2019ll help you get to sleep. I have ankylosing spondylitis, and then it started in my teens. So I do know what it feels like, and it\u2019s good to know that your parents Are on your side. Another good thing to help you sleep, again get your parents permission, and don\u2019t overdo it. Would be the standard dosage of Benadryl. But it doesn\u2019t work on everyone like that. It makes my sister psychotic, she says she wants to kill someone when she\u2019s on it. The last thing I leave you with is this, in my experience over the decades, I have found others may not share this opinion, but university Hospital systems are normally good at trying to get to the bottom of the pain. At least the one where I\u2019m at, it\u2019s not just hey here\u2019s a painkiller, they actually want to know what\u2019s causing the pain.",

        "text": "Morning dude/dudette, I feel you there!  For so many years I soldiered on and said things in response to \"how are you?\", whether it's \"fine\" \"surviving\" \"been better, but been worse, too\" etc.There was a meeting at my former place of work about mental health and supporting each other, we had a fairly decent group working there (with a few exceptions, of course).  I turned up to meet one of the guys on site & they asked how I am...  So I told them that my pains are getting worse and that my Mum had been diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer, so I'm not doing too great, really?!His response was \"Christ, wish I hadn't asked now!\"I have full body pains, different body parts on different days apart from a couple of conditions that are pretty much full on.I don't think I would want a day without my disabilities or pains, because it would break me having to go through all the brain training that I did to control and ignore certain pain.  And not only that, I cannot remember the last time I was in a pain free state.  So to me it would be a curse, because to feel the relief of being pain free, only to get it all back in one great lump.Saying that... One of the things I miss the most, is walking on the beach, holding hands with my wife. So, in that regard, I would do it, because I miss that so much. \ud83d\udda4",

Life expectancy in the US rose from 68 years in 1950 to 79 years in 2019, with some drops thereafter attributed to the Covid pandemic.  Significant reductions in child mortality rates have played a crucial role in increasing overall life expectancy. Improvements in sanitation, vaccination programs, and healthcare access have been pivotal.In the present US political environment, vaccination is under challenge by anti-Vaxxer nut jobs and childhood measles and whooping cough are again on the rise.  Reduction of US State and Local spending by the new Administration could substantially reduce efforts to refurbish waste processing facilities and replace lead piping in major urban centers -- both of which are necessary to maintain even the public health services and life expectancy that we have.  Climate change will also increase death rates associated with weather catastrophes and pollution of world water supplies.   Rising levels of homelessness and refugee populations also significantly impact life expectancy in the United States.Was this posting placed as satire or a joke? If so, perhaps I have missed the intended joke.",

It was an emergency situation so whoever was on call operated. Fast forward it's been 15 years. He's retired. No one will see me. Even the doctors at the same practice will not take my case.My GP has sent referrals to every ortho within 50 miles. They review my chart and say I'm sorry we can't help you. Thing is I know that. Duh it's been 15 years I know there's no help at this point. No more operations no more therapy no more injections etc. My surgery was labeled as failed. Ive been hunch back for 15 years now. My failed back surgeries have led to TKR HP and now neck injections. I just want to see someone for documentation. Anything I can do? Can I get my insurance involved? Thanks",

        "text": "A lot is going to depend on your insurer. It sounds like your GP is in your corner, so thats a good thing. Orthopedic doctors like to build shit. I see them all as having the biggest collections of tinker toys and leggos as kids. They built a cage, ran some rods through it, and screwed it all together to fix your back. Structurally it might be brilliant. But pain is more about the nerves than structure...So how about a neurosurgical consult? Id be pretty sure one was in the OR just in case, while the orthopedic surgeon built and installed their contraptions. Pain really is all about the nerves, you cant have pain without them. Theres just 7 trillion in the human body to pick from. But neurosurgeons sometimes see a situation differently from an orthopedic surgeon, so they might have some options that an orthopedic surgeon couldnt offer.I dont know if this is worth mention or not, but if you are thinking about some of the big hospitals, Mayo, Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins and such, are not usually worth the travel hassle. You can get ripped of at home, cheaper. But doctors are individuals and thats how you have to take them. Dont be bedazzled by promises of magic cures. Youre better off finding somebody close to home, is my point.How about pain management? You doin okay? I know you'd rather have things fixed a little better physically, but theres no reason for suffering. It doesnt build character, it just hurts...hang in there.",

I had to walk back to the butcher then wait for my order so when I got to the register my knee was done. I reached in the cart to load my groceries and fell in the check out line. It was more embarrassing than painful. When I got home I couldn't walk and literally wanted to die. I feel like shit and don't see a way up? I hate people seeing me at my worst on public irrational as that may be.its been hours and I'm sort of mobile but mentally, emotionally beat. I always get back up but genuinely wonder how many bounce backs I have in me?Hope y'all are doing better than I am \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udfff",

        "text": "I\u2019m a talent manager - hybrid work model so office days and work from home days, it can be a high stress job but I\u2019m good at it and it\u2019s easier for me with my pain than what I started in (social media content creation/management and pr/influencer marketing management) as it\u2019s more on the admin/organisation and comms side versus the technical and creative side which required more work, longer hours/overtime and more in-officeI\u2019ll be honest, it helps that my office is close to home and my boss and small team is super understanding- I often break out the neck massager, heat pack, have to do random stretches or pace around in office, kneeling on the floor while working because my neck/back is spasming and I can\u2019t bend my head to \u2018straight forward\u2019 when that happens (I look ridiculous and if it was a bigger corp/office they\u2019d probably send me home and eventually lay me off for not being \u2018capable\u2019 or being a distraction or something) but my boss understands and can see I get my work done and well I just am having flare ups at the same time. If I wasn\u2019t working I\u2019d still have the same flare ups anyway, I\u2019ve adjusted. If it\u2019s really bad she will let me go home early either clocking off or to wfh and be more comfy, or I can call in in the morning and say I need to wfh and that\u2019s okay too, and I can make up hours on different days too!I think definitely getting a job that you find enjoyable and is something you\u2019re good at (so you don\u2019t have too much stress, and you can prove your capability for when your pain causes issues at work) and that\u2019s either fully remote or a hybrid model, ideally with a small team, and a boss that is understanding, flexible and accommodating - without these aspects, I\u2019d probably be unemployed right now \ud83e\udd72I\u2019m not too sure on the insurance side of things though - I\u2019m Aussie so we don\u2019t get insurance with work and have free/affordable healthcare so it\u2019s never been a concern. I truly feel for you having that concern when you have chronic pain though, I can only begin to imagine how stressful and hard that is.Wishing you the best of luck\u2665\ufe0f",

        "text": "Yes and no. You can.... but it is a long shot. It requires anextremelypatient and understanding partner who enjoys just sitting around with you. Also, you have to be understanding that sitting around all day, everyday, gets old quick for people without disabling health issues and they are going to want to go out and do things. Personality and patience is key here.As a 37 year old guy, in order to go dating like a regular person, I'm expected to be making enough money to support myself and still have enough left over to do fun things with whomever I'm dating. Living on disability doesn't even come close to that level of income. Going out and having fun is a challenge and often impossible. So I learned to enjoy the company of others, even if we are just sitting on the floor doing stretches together. Doesn't cost us anything. If I end up hurting myself I don't have to worry about getting home like I would if we were to go to a place like an amusement park. Sometimes the dance with no pants happens. Sometimes it doesn't. So that just happens when it does and if the ability to do so is there. Muscle relaxers like baclofen can make it difficult.Also, it's a good idea to let them know that it's 100% ok to leave you behind to go out and have fun. You don't want to be envious of their abilities. Being able to set those negative feelings aside gives your partner a guilt-free pass to go live their life and have fun doing things they enjoy, even if you aren't there too. My last girlfriendlovesto go hiking. She goes all over the US to hike trails.  We both would love for me to go but we also both know that would mean stressing over if my legs will hold up or is she going to end having to drag my 6'1 220 lbs ass down a mountain.Many people can not handle this kind of relationship so the chances are rather slim. Not completely impossible. Just improbable. You need to have seriously awesome qualities outside the physical to have people even give you a chance when there areso manyother people looking for the same thing.",

        "text": "Ill just open this up with the statement: I don't blame EVERYTHING on pain, even though it has influenced everything. I was happily married for 8/10 years, with chronic pain for 9 of them until now, my pain was properly managed for 8 of those years. We were separated for a year prior to divorce (following along?) When my pain management failed my life failed, i no longer was capable of doing or enjoying anything due to pain. I could not fulfil my duties as a man, including financially and sexually, we became celibate for a year. I lost our home. I became frustrated with myself and my lack of ability. I lashed out towards my wonderful wife who was always very patient and loving. (There are other things at play, i dont regret the divorce)  ANYWAYS, all that to say if your pain is managed appropriately and you can maintain a reasonable quality of life, your pain shouldn't be a burden on anyone. Surely you may have to avoid quite a few things, but there are many more things you can experience and enjoy together. A reasonable person who cares for you will make accommodations for things you cannot. You are not required to spend every waking moment with the one you love, in fact I would say that is in opposition to a healthy relationship. I don't know your personal needs, but everyone is so diverse its extremely unlikely there isn't someone for you. There are many relationships where they literally begin with the SO acting as a lover and caregiver from the start, everyone has their own attitudes towards everything, no one can truly be boxed. Also I want you to know, generally speaking your place in the world sexually is extremely valuable, you are a clean slate without relationship based emotional baggage. That alone puts you leagues above almost everyone.",

        "text": "Hey There!I think its very hard to answer your question because its is dependant on alot of things but I can share my own experience. I have had chronic pain for the last 5 years and am currently in a relationship. One that is very healthy and supportive.I am with a person who is very much a homebody, like me. Someone who is capable of maintaining their own hobbies and activities and appreciates time alone or in paralel play (sitting in the same room doing different things). This works for both me as a person and regarding my chronic pain. I can sit on the couch or nap away the day and he is perfectly content doing his own thing. That on its own ofcourse isn't enough. Every relationship, regardless of pain and illness, takes effort.I read quite a few stories in which someone with chronic pain gets broken up with because of it. I'd say open communication (like any other relationship) is key here. A space where the partner of the ill person can express their needs without being jugded for them. Living together with a chronic ill person can be hard and we shouldn't refute that. So being open about it, both ways, works.One thing that is a natural part of having chronic pain is that it, for a time, becomes a bit of an identity. It disrupts your whole life and fucks with every part of you. Through therapy I have been able to let go of this \"Identity\" and found a balance between what is my pain and what is really me as a person. This is in my opinion important when you are, or want to be, in a relationship.Ofcourse its hard to find a good match when you are healthy, nevermind when you need to match with someone who is willing and able to care the way you need them to. That doesn't mean it is not possible. Many of us have loving partners and I am one of those lucky people.Don't undermine your own worth, your illness doesn't determine who you are <3",

She applauds me for everything I do, no matter how small, and makes me feel so good even when my inability to do things makes me feel worthless.We were married on 12/1 and I couldn't be happier. So, to answer your question, yes. It's certainly possible with the right person. I hope you find someone who can be empathetic and caring and who will build you up.",

My disorder hasn't stopped me from having an amazing life, full of love and adventure. I've been in love, married twice, had 2 beautiful daughters (1 died from the same disease that I have), and had not one, but 2 fulfilling careers. I've lived in some beautiful places, and traveled to many more.I won't be around much longer, but I\u2019m still grateful for every day that I wake up. The pain is excruciating, but there are people I love to spend time with, and still places I want to see. So I pull myself together and make the most of every moment.I hope that all of you won\u2019t waste precious time when there is so much life to be lived. \ud83d\udc96\ud83c\udf40\ud83c\udf08\ud83e\udd8b\u267f\ufe0f\ud83d\udc95",

It was a clear and well written letter asking for a referral for inpatient for mental health as well as for a request to help me figure out how to manage pain better with a nurse or something similar.I got a call this afternoon and got yelled at. He said he couldn't do anything regarding the note because I didn't sign a release (said angrily). And that he's been trying to help me but bc I haven't taken an anti-depressant (I did, he just forgot) I'm being difficult. And he feels like I'm abusing him by sending him the message for help. \"You put me in a bad place\" \"I can't just drop my case load\"I was stunned. Still am, hours later. He actually yelled at me for asking for help. I couldn't say much because I was in so much shock. I apologized to him multiple times.Suddenly, I understand why so many people are choosing to take their own life. Add in chronic pain and opiates and it gets even worse. I know why it is such a huge problem here now. This is the response when asking for help???I'm shocked and never setting a single foot near that clinic again. Even it means being without pain meds (soon) until I get into another doctor.I never ever thought this would be the response. Never ever ever",

He yelled and cursed at me accusing me of not taking my medications and \"making him look like a shitty doctor\" . He then threatened to drop me as a patient if I didn't get my A1C under 7 in the next 30 days as though he had no idea that the test is roughly a 90 day average of blood glucose.I told him to use his Express scripts or contact the pharmacy to see that I was filling and picking up my prescriptions and snapped back at me that he knew I picked them up but I wasn't taking them. I asked him why he thought I would pick up expensive prescriptions and simply not take them. Then he started yelling again about how I was making him look like a shitty doctor and if I didn't turn things around in 30 days he was going to drop me as a patient.My husband was thankfully with me and we were both in shock and I was feeling thoroughly demoralized. Two days later I received a registered letter from the shitty doctor dropping me as a patient claiming I was uncooperative, etc. I filed a complaint against him with the medical board that went nowhere because he simply lied and said that never happened and I was mentally unstable.After I found a new primary care physician I discovered how poorly managed my care was with him. I also learned that he was not a board certified family practitioner, pediatrician or gerontologist as he claimed. He went to medical school in a developing country and did only what was necessary to receive his MD without any special residency or fellowships. That's all legal but shady as hell. What an absolute douchebag.I have to ask myself how people like your doctor and my former one get away with treating people that way. I hope you find a much better primary care physician who is compassionate and kind. \u2764\ufe0f",

        "text": "Best advice I've gotten was to make the doctor note in your medical file that they refused your request, and in your case, make sure your letter is included in their report. Youll be surprised how quickly they change their tune and want to help you.Its normal to bring/consult a support person, you ARE his case load, and your requests aren't over and above what he should be doing for you as your doctor. Telling him you're struggling with your condition isnt putting him in a bad place, other than making him frustrated that he doesn't know how to help you - which is a problem for them personally and professionally, not a problem with you or your approach.We arent given a handbook for how to handle chronic pain or how to navigate the healthcare system, but they have taken years of school to learn how to be a doctor. They've taken 7+ years of training and are the one who is supposed to behave professionally and empathetically when their patients are struggling.For what it's worth, male doctors/surgeons have never, ever treated me like a human being in my life. I've generally had better care from women, but even then, the medical system is rigged against us. You should read 'Doing Harm' my Maya Dusenbery if you havent already.What state do you live in if you dont mind sharing? Is there a pain clinic in your area that you could be referred to?I saw your posts about nerve blocks and wanted to add that nerve root blocks worked great for my particular problem. It was a spine injury, so take this with a grain of salt, but they didn't work great for me at first and I almost gave up, but it took a few sessions for the nerve to heal enough that I could get off the gabapentin/lyrica. Your pain threshold is high and sometimes you dont notice improvement until a few injections in. Don't discontinue those treatments until youve had 3 or 4 injections if you can.Hope some of this is helpful.",

Can\u2019t hold my phone, can\u2019t roll over to change positions, in too much pain to drift back to sleep.If husband is around, he often notices I\u2019m awake but doing \u201cnothing\u201d (nothing except surviving my waking hours one excruciating minute at a time) so he typically asks what\u2019s up. He is kind and caring but always forgets that I often can\u2019t do anything but exist.After anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, I finally resign myself to taking pain medication and maybe my other meds, too. Often, though, I just focus on the pain meds, telling myself I\u2019ll take the rest once I\u2019ve taken the edge off my pain.And that\u2019s all my pain meds do these days, take the edge off just enough to pull me back from the ledge.Before I went on LTD and eventually got SSDI, my days were similar to OP foryearsexcept that I didn\u2019t work from home until the last six months before I had to leave the workforce permanently. I know from experience, though, there is NOTHING more exhausting than wearing the brave mask of normalcy for work/school/family/life while dealing with crippling pain so severe it\u2019d send most people to urgent care.It\u2019s exhausting being us, no doubt. We all deserve a gold star and real medical treatment by curious, caring, skilled & knowledgeable doctors, pharmacists, therapists and insurance companies!!",

        "text": "Keep doing it. Because the result is me on SSI where you can't get any help. Why you can't get any meds. And now because I'm on Medicaid the one Medicaid facility in my area has been hacked so I can't even get a call to a doctor. If I'm lucky my meds will go through if I'm not I'm screwed. And since there's no computers working no phones working for the facility and all the doctors I'm screwed. So I can't even beg for help. So what you do is you write down whenever you take your meds. Figure what's happening is you're taking too many then when you go and you take the regular amount you're going through depression withdrawal. Not to mention the fact that you don't sleep. I'm on the high blood pressure medicine clonidine I was just put on it because I was almost dead 191 systolic daily it is knocking me out if I don't take it when I'm supposed to I get a headache I still have a headache now because I tried to push it 3 hours so I could stay awake. I have no freaking support I'm being audited still by SSI I can't find an attorney for that and I really need one I cannot make many calls because I'm so sedated from blood pressure medicine and that doesn't do anything for the pain it just makes me so sedated that my visions blurred I can't talk very well I'm so tired sorry that was actually a yawn with that. Also causes the pain to get worse in certain areas. No there's no other medicine I can take. And I can't get advice from my car they all just because naturally some jerk had to hack it and make it so that medical people couldn't even get in touch with the patients and the patients couldn't get in touch with the medical people. No hospitals no er's. And there's three in the local area. And so they did this not to PIH they did it to the clients. . Doesn't care if the clients can't get a hold of the doctors so why would somebody hack them and ask for a ransom. . Just never going to pay a ransom clients are suffering. Especially if you're disabled in a mobile you're vastly suffering. Yes this sucks you're right it sucks but it gets worse if you don't keep doing what you're doing. end up where I am??",

You have hope that's when you stop working or can't work that you have no hope no support isolation and ultimately just wait for death. But if you're working even a little bit in front of a screen in which there is money coming in we've grown to association that's success. I know you hate the idea that you got up you hate the idea that you didn't sleep all night you hate the idea that you've got to take another pill that probably doesn't work very well and if it worked well you'd sleep at night. Think you're at the level though that you can still do stuff behaviorally have an air bed. Unless you got spinal problems and airbed helps a lot. Riding down when you take the medicine helps so that there is actually that level in your body because if you end up on SSI they're going to not give you medicine and before they do that if you go to pain management doctor they're going to make you urinate into a cup and if you're taking too much they're going to get rid of you so write it down what you take the time you take it put a big clock a pair of paper that has a date on the clock write it down have a bunch of pens just right there every time you take it beside your bed if you have to write it down don't swallow it without writing it down 10 in one hand pill on the other I mean literally. Been where you are. I'm sorry it is so bad. Don't know what you're taking. But pain medicine never did that to me but I am enlightened now and the last week or so being on this clonidine for blood pressure but sincerely is dope me up more than any narcotic I have ever imagined except it doesn't relieve pain so I got to write everything down now too or I don't even know what I took. So I cuz miserate with you my friend and my phone won't write properly so I am so sorry. Why cuz clonidine makes your throat so dry that the phone can't hear you right and I have an accent. And I don't know how long I'll be stoned and clonidine and I've got court to go to. I can't find a free pro bowl lawyer for social security no can't find it for you all year none of them do what's called reevaluation or AUDIT for SSI. The places that did don't need more because they're financially broke and don't have the staff I've been told today three times. So my day really sucked too I'm sorry I got out of the bed also really regret it. Actually I have just a couch. I'm hungry but I didn't do any shopping and I don't even think I could get to the kitchen at this point. So I'm going to sign off with I understand how you feel but you're not at the end of the tunnel it can get a lot worse for those that don't want it to get worse trust me do some of the things I recommend stay employed right everything down. Timeless medications so they hit you mostly at night not during the day if you can. That's if you can bear the pain long enough. Unfortunately in my situation I have to take this every 12 hours pass out for 6 to 8 hours I'm a total zombie and it's just blood pressure medication and I have severe pain issues that doesn't even help the pain but not me into a zombie with pain. And there's absolutely no support. I might as well be talking to the wall. And it's dirty so I don't want to talk to it. Sorry that you're in the situation trust me get it scheduled if you have to put a clock everywhere that pallet paper right by your medicine you don't touch that medicine until you have the pen in one hand the pill on the other when it's written down you can take the medicine stick it in your mouth real fast. Not until it's written down. Keep track of the meds try to make them at night or towards the time of closing of business if you're working. Learn how long it takes the meds to affect you. It takes an hour before you start losing it. Take an hour before you have to check out of your work computer. Give a bottle of water near the pad. Oh as far as the dogs go time to get auto feed. Time to get all the water. And time to get a collar reacting doggie door. Make sure they don't get your meds. Those things help a lot. I hope this helps you in some way and a lot of us understand how you feel. So sorry. I am trying will take ideas if anybody has them.",

    "content": "Today my boyfriend of a year told me he doesn\u2019t think I should be taking my opioid pain medication any longer. I have had chronic pain for 18 years, have tried every single thing I could think of, that was recommended to me, have had multiple surgeries, and ended up with CRPS in my right hip/thigh. I also have widespread OA and PsA, and my biologic has recently been changed so not yet effective. I cannot take NSAIDs because of multiple duodenal ulcers, two ending in GI bleeds and hospitalization. I have had minimal luck with lyrica and gabapentin. So, opioids. I have been on them intermittently for 18 years, and consistently for about 8. At the same dose for 6, no escalating doses, no problems with scripts, etc. I get pretty good relief from them, and my quality of life is much better since I was put on this dose. I can now walk my dog, and go to my daughter\u2019s sports games. Things I couldn\u2019t do before, and things I am not about to give up because someone I have known for a year, who \u201cdid some reading\u201d, thinks he knows better than I do. Recommended thinking positive. wow, I hadn\u2019t thought of that!!! Wow, wish someone had told me that 18 years ago!  Needless to say, I chose my pain control and he is now my ex. I thought I had found someone who accepted me for me, but I guess that wasn\u2019t the case.",

I know it is the pill most of the time but it\u2019s one of the few times I truly feel happy and comfortable. I can feel the warmth in the base of my neck radiate out and for a few hours it honestly feels like things might not be so bad. I am just so run down, tired, and hurt. I just want to be able to live my life and feel like everyone else. I want to be able to do the things I love without being in constant pain just from motion. Pain might be a mental battle as well as physical but that is the one thing that really keeps the lights on for me and gives me the strength to keep pushing everyday.

He would frequently have to clean her up before the younger siblings got home from school. He's been very supportive because he's seen what actual addiction looks like, and also he came to all the doctor appointments with me (he had to drive me) after my botched surgery so he heard what the doctors said.

        "text": "As sad as it may be for you right now, believe me, if your DOCTOR APPROVED this medication regimen & it is not causing you any problems or concerns regarding addiction & is giving you back your quality of life, you have made the right decision.Unfortunately, thanks to certain entities, there are two vastly different schools of thought about this subject these days. The staunch naysayers- those that have fallen for all of the controversy & bad press, will not bring themselves to educate themselves any further about those of us for which this can be a lifesaver...(except to perhaps immerse themselves into all of the incomplete research which can reinforce their own negative position).For someone that knows you & actually cares about whether you suffer needlessly or not, there is a ton of accurate information out there to be found.Thinking positive is great & it is necessary & even vital for chronic pain patients to BE POSITIVE as much as possible, but it isn't going to help with real pain from actual chronic conditions & diseases that ravage the body with inflammation & pain. Whoever came up with THAT idea has never truly suffered.These medications can be relatively safe for certain legitimate medical conditions. They can truly save some of us from a lifetime of agony...when absolutely nothing else has helped.However, once some people fall for the propaganda, you will not change their mind. They have not had our experiences with pain. They are unable or unwilling to understand or \"get it.\" Once they have developed their opinion & climb up on that soap box to lecture, their mind is made up & set in stone. They have decided that the very thing, that quite often is our last resort for relief, after trying virtually everything else... is somehow evil. There are risks & benefits with all medications.Even as RESPONSIBLE patients who follow our doctor's instructions to the letter, there is still no convincing some people that they are WRONG. To them, the severity of our pain or how many times they have witnessed our struggles & limitations without help, just doesn't matter. They have decided it is somehow morally wrong to NEED relief from debilitating, disabling pain. To NEED to be able to participate in LIFE.A person that disregards your suffering & your needs... That isn't love...The ONLY thing that could ever make \"them\" change their minds, sadly would be if they became one of US. Accidents & illnesses can happen to anyone at any time in this life... So many people don't realize the fragility of the human body. It makes you wonder if they think that they could somehow bear such debilitating, constant pain without any help themselves? Truth is- they probably think it will never happen TO THEM.Live your life for yourself & your children. If you have found a good, compassionate doctor, be endlessly grateful for any blessed relief YOU CAN GET.Someone wonderful will come along with an open, non-judgemental & truly caring heart who will support you through your pain & struggles, rejoice in your comfort & LOVE YOU unconditionally.... I'm fairly sure that wasn't him.",

Both sides hurt, but my right is worse. At around 12 a specialist diagnosed me with hEDS, but later rescinded the diagnosis, though I don\u2019t remember exactly why. I am now 18 and still struggling. I have been tested for arthritis and that is negative. Every time I go to a doctor they run labs, tell me everything is normal, then send me home. I am at the point I am seriously considering getting a cane. Has anyone had a similar experience or have any advice? Thank you so much :)",

        "text": "I think it's ultimately a communication and learning issue, because your current pain, might be considered 6 or 7 through observation of you by a third party. But pre chronic illness, you accurately would have been reacted to the pain like it was 10/10. It's just now you've learnt to tolerate it, so your outward expression of the pain is a 7, when it's really might be closer to a 10 for a normal person.This is compounded further with everyone experiencing pain differently because of their body and history/experience with pain. It is kind of logical to normal people that if you experience a 10/10 pain, that you should technically be screaming in agony. So medical professionals who haven't experience daily pain for a prolonged time, tend to not understand how pain tolerance over a long period presents. It creates a really awkward dynamic between patient and caregiver, because they might think you're a exaggerating pain based on their observation, but they simply can't understand your perspective, and throw a false judgement on you.The pain scale really isn't fit for chronic patients in this regard. They could separate it out for patients in long term pain vs those with an acute condition, or ask for two types of pain scores, or a score based on how much your pain has increased in 24hrs/1week etc, rather than how much your pain is out of 10. Even then, sometimes I worry my chronic pain is masking an acute injury, so it's a hard one to balance.",

        "text": "I have had severe chronic illness for almost twenty years now, lots of hospitalizations, surgeries, central lines and tubes and devices etc. (Just to be clear that I have experienced this, I'm not judging from afar).My pain management doctor explained his stance on this in a way that makes a lot of sense to me but seems controversial in the chronic illness community. This is how he explained how to work the pain scale for me and it's how I always rate my pain when I'm in the hospital, recovering from surgery, stuff like that, and it's served me pretty well so far.We are supposed to rate our pain byhow it affects us.So, for a normal person:Bee Sting: 2. Ouchy! But no big deal, I can continue with my day.Sprained Ankle: 6. BIG ouchy! Hurts a lot, I need medication, but I can grit my teeth and make it through my day with modifications (stay off ankle)Kidney Stone: 9. Horrific pain! I'm rolling around in bed sobbing! I need a doctor, I need an IV, I need this issue fixed right now, I cannot be at home!But for a chronic pain patient, our scale is different. Bee sting doesn't even register. Sprained ankle is no big deal, this is the level of pain I'm used to. A kidney stone might be a 9 for most people, but for me, it affects me like a 6 would affect other people - I'm not rolling around in bed sobbing and unable to function, I can grit my teeth and take oral pain meds and get through it, because I'm used to high levels of pain.But I should rate thiskidney stone painas a 6, not a 9. A 9 would still be whatever causes this loss of function and severe, catastrophic pain. So maybe for a regular person, or someone with a low threshold, a 9 for them is a kidney stone or a broken ankle. Maybe for me to get to a 9 it would take way more, I would have to have my broken femur sticking through my skin, etc. But the scale is for how the painaffects me.What do you guys think about this? It's how I always rate my pain. If I'm upright and able to have a calm conversation, my pain is always less than a 7, even if for another person, that level of pain would be a 9 or similarly debilitating.This viewpoint has worked pretty well for me. I never rate my pain above like a 6 or 7 as long as I'm still able to hold a conversation and focus, and I never have any issues with being flagged as a drug seeker or dramatic/attention seeker. One of the nurses at the office I go to told me that people who do rate their pain at a 9 or 10 constantly (without showing 9 or 10 levels of debilitation) tend to be taken less seriously which I thought was interesting, and a little weird.",

I almost blacked out being brought into the  exam room. The nurse took one look at me and screamed to call an ambulance. My stupid self didn't even think they were yelling that for me.I got transferred to the hospital and taken in for immediate surgery. The day after a nurse asked me how long I had been living with this because she couldn't imagine. I had an ulcer and was bleeding internally the whole time until it had nowhere else to go.",

    "content": "Why don't they have sedation? Why is my doctor requiring another steroid shot when I've had 5 before that didn't work. It's so painful. I'm trying so hard not to catastrophize and have an anxiety attack but last time I felt like death would be better than that pain. I said I wouldn't ever get one again but my new provider is requiring it because, \"you've had them but never by me. Maybe they didn't do it in the right spot.\" I've even had radial ablation in the same spot and that didn't help.I'm a woman in my early 30s and have had this pain for over 10 years. I just want a life with less pain. I'm not even asking for no pain, just less. Sorry for the rant I just needed to get something out there I guess. Maybe I'll come back in a few hours and say it was totally fine and I didn't need to worry.Edit post injection: it went really well! I explained how traumatic the last one was (and avoided crying!) They went super slow and did a little lido at every advancement. They were sort of laughing at me at the end because I was so anxious which I found a bit annoying but it wasn't untrue. I basically just said they would be too if the last one was so painful you passed out during it. I've never actually felt the numbing go where the pain was so I'm (extremely) cautiously optimistic that it actually might help. Thanks everyone!!",

If they don't work for you, the adverse effects on ligaments--softening them and interfering with their growth and healing--wouldn't seem to be worth it to me, and if that's how you feel, ask for lidocaine only, if you have a reason for a diagnostic injection.  This can be done.They can certainly test the location beforehand using lidocaine only and IF and only if the lidocaine that comes with all steroids never helped you with your shots before and the lidocaine helps now, perhaps that's an indication that his injection would help you.If the lidocaine helped before but the steroid did not, then that should be an indication that steroid won't help this time.It is your right to refuse any treatment that doesn't work for you.Are you up to speed on the negative side effects of steroids?  Would you like some papers on it?  Feel free to DM me or just reply here and I'll link some.  Sometimes some links can get stripped out of some subs and I don't recall if this sub is one of them, but I'll certainly try.Also what is the diagnosis or the attempt at diagnosis that's being made here, and do you by chance have hypermobility?",

The other was a different doctor (lumbar) & it was okay. I had sedation twice at the beginning. I don't think it even affected me and I had to sit for an hour after. I chose to not do sedation anymore. They were surprised.Not many would do the neck. Do you know that it's only a short class to learn it? I believe they contribute to the osteoporosis. Possibly the cause. Doctors were surprised that I denied the sedation. Radio ablation did not work. I wouldn't do it ever again.Edit: radial",

Now I have cartilage and bones that are deteriorating at a rapid pace. If you don\u2019t want the shots cancel the appointment and find someone else that will listen to you.

    "content": "Holy crap!!!!!I accidentally threw myself into gabapentin withdrawal yesterday (usually take 1,200mg/day) while being nauseous from my new Suboxone. I was throwing up everything bc of the Suboxone (working to find the right dose), I couldn\u2019t hold anything down! For about half an hour I felt fine and decided to take 300mg gabapentin and 10mg baclofen. About 3 min later I became ill again and threw it up and stayed that way until this morning when I found myself sweating in my sheets way too much, shivering uncontrollably and sweating and dizzy on top of being nauseous. I was extremely anxious and couldn\u2019t catch a breath. I desperately needed something to calm down and I ran out of my CBD so I cut my 300 in half to be easy on my stomach and in about 5 minutes I felt soooooooooo relieved!!! Still very nauseous but not, like, freaking tf outIt was unbelievable!!!!!Never want that again!!!!It was about only 24 hours since I had had my last one",

    "content": "Backstory: I have central nervous system issues and they can\u2019t seem to find the cause. I also have chronic inflammations of tendons and ligaments in every joint. I have an unnamed autoimmune disease that Drs have given up on finding the answer. I have 2 neurostimulators for failed back and neck surgery. I take contramal/tramadol 150 retard 2x/day. And then some muscle relaxers. I\u2019ve been taking this for 17 years. Actually until 6 years ago I took even more.April 2nd I flipped my ankle just getting up from the sofa to get ready for a Drs appointment. I felt intense pain for a few minutes and put ice on it immediately. I made it to the Drs appointment. She looked at it and sent me to get an RX and ultrasound. I completely tore 1 ligament and tore another 1/2. I did rehab for 2 months and my mobility and balance was ok. The swelling and pain wasn\u2019t. The end of august I see a specialist, he was very kind, gave me an corticosteroid injection and told me to come back 3 weeks later. Swelling was better but not gone. Pain was still there. He told me to get an NMR and come back. (Our hospitals merged and it has been a shitshow ever since) I didn\u2019t get my NMR because my battery from my neurostimulator wasn\u2019t fully charged. First time hearing this. I told my pain management doctor and she laughed. I flipped my ankle again on dec 1. Anyway, so I just had a new NMR on dec 16th and saw my surgeon on the 18th. He asked me why it took so long. I told him the story about my battery from my neurostimulator and he goes off \u201cwell, if you have a NS, you absolutely can\u2019t have an NMR!\u201d I said I could and had probably had 20 since getting it. He goes off again \u201cso you must be really special to get a NS that can go under an NMR\u201d. I was shocked. Then he goes off that since I have a NS, I shouldn\u2019t be taking pain meds. I said I do because they can\u2019t get to the full region where my pain is. He goes off again! \u201cYou just like to take them because you get high from them. You should stop taking them. And your muscles relaxers because that\u2019s why you flip your ankle.\u201d I told him im not getting high on them. I\u2019ve been taking this dose for 17 years and if I\u2019m having a good day, I even forget to take then. And with his logic, shouldn\u2019t I have flipped my ankle many times before in those 17 years?!\u201d He had no reply. He prescribed 6 weeks of rehab, never mentioned my NMR and I left his office. I just was able to check the protocol of the NMR. Conclusion was: inflammation of complete ankle joint, 2 ruptures in important ligament and signs of lesser or lack of blood flow to a piece of bone where another ligament attaches. So that makes a complete infected joint, 1 completely torn ligament and 2 other ligaments with 1 or 2 tears and a piece of bone that lacks good bloodflow. But it was more important to call me a liar about my NS and to call me a junkie. He did check my other joints to see if I was overly flexible but no. He said my ankle has muscle issues, almost no strength and that I probably have an injured nerve but who cares. I think he thinks I came for extra pain meds and because he was pulling and twisting my ankle and i didn\u2019t say \u2018au\u2019 I was faking it. I\u2019m a pain patient! I don\u2019t cry when it\u2019s not a 8 at least! I had shockwave therapy and my therapist said the second time he didn\u2019t understand why i wasn\u2019t yelling and/or crying! He said it\u2019s the most painful place to get it done. He said most men can\u2019t handle a full session. It was painful but if you can\u2019t handle 10min of real pain, you haven\u2019t experienced a 10 before. His secretary told me she gets sick when she sees someone coming in for an elbow shockwave because she hears everyone scream. I thought it was funny because a friend that works in the hospital, was standing next to me when she said that. He asked if it really is that painful and she said it\u2019s one of the most painful non sedated procedures. Anyway. I\u2019m calling another surgeon on Monday and I tell him I\u2019m a pain patient and I don\u2019t \u2018au\u2019 for less than an 8.",

And also for a reason other than depression (The depression of course, is caused by decades of this pain). The ketamine infusions immediately stopped my suicidality, as well as my depression. I recommend checking into Ketamine. There is a protocol for ketamine being used for pain. It involves much higher doses. Perhaps get approved for depression purposes, and then maybe go on from there and use it for pain.",

        "text": "When you say NMR I\u2019m assuming you mean MRI?There are plenty of neurostimulation systems that are able to be scanned safely. That doctor needs to leave MR safety to the professionals who deal with it everyday since clearly he has no idea what he\u2019s talking about. Your neurosurgeon wasn\u2019t treating you special by giving you a scannable model, he was giving you a model that fits your healthcare needs and that was good and very normal.I\u2019m so sorry you dealt with this and I hope your new surgeon is much kinder. Make sure you talk about your mri results with the surgeon and your physical therapist. Also, the exam they do where they bend and twist your foot\u2014 please let them know when it does hurt even if it\u2019s a small amount of pain. You don\u2019t have to say ow or react (and any doctor worth their salt should know not to expect dramatic reactions when. Chronic pain is involved). Just a \u201cthat feels tender\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s uncomfortable\u201d is good!",

        "text": "I was yelled at and called a junkie by a pain management doctor. I went to see her because my pain management was making me come in once a month and I didn't want to go that often and my PCP recommended that I see her. I'd called before to make sure she dealt with adhesions because I'd talked to others who only worked with spinal issues or arthritis. The receptionist put me on hold to ask & came back to say yes, she did. This woman (the doctor) screamed at me because, she claimed, adhesions don't cause the kind of pain I was describing & I should have checked before I came in to see if she would even see me about adhesions! Then I was a liar on top of being an addict because who would call and ask that? That's when I knew why the woman in the waiting room was sobbing into her cell phone.I would bet half the people on this page have gone through the same thing and it's terrible that we're treated so badly, which I'm sure doesn't make you feel any better. I'm sorry they were so mean to you. I hope you do better with the next surgeon. I'm 20 years into this and the only people who were like that (so far) were that doctor and a nurse in the ER who decided I was there for pain meds because I was on pain meds. Telling her I already had plenty did nothing to convince her otherwise. I don't know what au is.",

I got an mri and it turned out that I fractured my cuboid and the X-ray didn\u2019t pick it up. I spent four months in pain, barely getting any pain meds, doing a corticosteroid shot in my foot, before they even cast it. I wore a cast for four weeks, and my cuboid took almost nine months to heal and it\u2019s still not healed right. I gave up on asking for anymore pain meds for it as the pain management where I live is a joke.Pain is relative for people especially those with chronic pain.

The year i finally had surgery i underwent 3 separate fractures in ankle and tibia due to ankle dislocations WHILE wearing a full laced ankle brace with stability plates.Never once did i wince or say ow other than each time i fell. Chronic pain forces us to endure what others term 10/10 unbearable pain as what i would guess is maybe a 3-4(basically heaven) on yours and my own daily pain level.Cannot tell you how many people I hear complaining about facet joint injections or other minor procedures which at this point affect me no more than a single tear on the injected side. No stress, no words. I cannot help but laugh everytime a Dr. or RN. says \"this may hurt a bit\". They truly do not comprehend what suffering is nor what TRUE GRIT it takes to endure with composure as what other choice do we have?Apologies I just wanted to write a smidge of empathetic support abd turned it into a grouse session.

I've been to numerous PTs, neurologists, orthopedics and whatnot and I cannot seem to get this issue fixed and it's been affecting my daily life where I cannot workout or do any sports.I have a disc bulge in my cervical spine, where there's nerve impingement caused by the C6-C7 disc bulge.My neck does not have curvature and is straight.My left shoulder is more forward, which is probably caused by tight pectoral muscles and weak back/trap muscles. My muscles on the back towards the left shoulder don't seem to activate at all when an EMG? is done (electricity is passed through a needle in that area and it should contract, but it doesn't). My left arm feels week, my ring finger feels numb at times and my forearm, triceps and traps on the left side feel tense all the time. It feels as if my hand is someone else's, if that even makes sense.I've been doing PT exercises at home such as neck chins, supermans, rotator cuff exercises with bandsm etc. but it just doesn't help. I've been seeing a PT since beginning of October 2-3x a week and there's barely any improvement and if there is, it fades away in 3-4-5 days. I've been to other PTs in 2020 and in 2022 and nothing helped there, but treatments were different there, too - mostly massages and electromagnet machines and heating laser.I really need some advise on what to do, because this is severely affecting my daily life. I've done MRIs on the neck area and I was told the disc bulges are mild and an operation is not necessary.",

Whether you\u2019re celebrating New Years alone, whether you\u2019re bed-ridden and can\u2019t partake in any festivities or whether you will somehow push yourself to go out for celebrations, only to end up with worse pains when you return back home.Just please remember that you are not alone in your pains tonight (and every night, especially in this subreddit) \ud83d\udc9cThis is just a reminder for all of us. You\u2019ve made it to another year of this HELL. You are incredibly strong to keep hanging on and continue fighting and living with these pains. You deserve to one day feel \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201chealthy\u201d once again and live a life without Chronic Pain. I\u2019d wish for nothing more than that, for all of us \ud83e\udd792025 is right around the corner.

I had tried the morphine at a much higher dose with no effect.The only issues I ever had was despite the pharmacy knowing me & that i would need to fill each month, they would give away my supply & I would have to wait.

He told me I failed opioid therapy and there were no other options for medications for pain management. When I mentioned methadone for pain he basically told me that would never happen and that I was free to find another pain clinic. That was 4 years ago. My new PCP sent in a referral to that same pain clinic as it's the only one that takes state insurance. Problem is I would have to see the same doctor. Their policy is once you see a doctor there, you can't change. So that's not going to happen.",

        "text": "You should have a cardiac checkup first. Methadone does something to your heart's timing, where you if already have this cardiac condition, it could be very dangerous to take methadone. You want a doc to check you for something called Q_T Prolongation on the cardiogram. If you dont have it, cool. If you do you may just have avoided a heart attack. You will still be constipated. Methadone dosing can be kind of tricky, half of todays dose will still be working tomorrow with a 30 hour half life.. Many dosing strategies, 2twice a day, 3 times, it really doesnt matter, it lasts 30 hours.  And it is very financially friendly drug, pennies a pill without insurance.If you had a recent cardiogram done you should be okay, but it never hurts to be sure. If you want more info try \"methadone/opioids\" and Q_T Prolongation in a search engine, you should get plenty of resultslike this. Really got to be careful about patients with undiagnosed heart issues. Most opioids cause a little Q_T Prolongation but with methadone it can be fatal. Methadone is a great pain drug once they get the dose correct and used with a degree of caution, you should have no trouble, but building up the dose may take a while. Just tell you doc whats going on....Good luck",

You can DM me or you can get messaging me so we can compare Medicaid your Kaiser Medicaid or compare My health net community Medicaid to which SSI says now people don't have choices for any kind which is strange because last year I got a slip thing I like care Kaiser Blue shield or health net Medicaid I chose health net because that's where I'd been before and I thought they had my records for the last 25 years. But now I get this thing that you weren't allowed to choose last year something's off. And then DPSS says oh no you can't renew your medical here you have to do it SSI go to SSI they send you the DPSS called Medi-Cal or Medicaid directly and they say oh it's DPSS job.

There is an old saying \u201cThe only thing worse than a smoker is an ex-smoker.\u201dMost people with CP learn that almost nobody cares about them, or have a very short tolerance for accommodations, and try to pass as much as possible, and have less energy for activism than the person in recovery who goes as hard and fast and completely into that as they did drugs in the first place.",

I fought taking the pain meds in the beginning because I had an illusion in my mind that I would be high and dopey. I don't even drink alcohol or use cannabis because I just don't like the feeling of being drunk or high. Once my pain got to the point it was keeping me from living my life and playing with my young daughter I caved and took them. Never once feeling any kind of high or euphoria, just takes the sharpness off the pain. Now I even more wonder why people who are not in pain take pain meds.",

So it's not about getting completely off of them if you needed them for chronic conditions, but getting back down to your baseline level. That has not been a problem for me so far with my pain clinic that has managed my meds once I returned from the hospital/physical rehab. (I recently had a major fusion from T4-S1, no one is going home on over the counter meds after that kind of back surgery).",

At first i was shocked but then i realized that as someone with both serious mental and physical conditions ,  I empathize.   Because most humans by default cannot compute the fact that mental agony can be just as bad, if not worse , than physical.    \"If you can't see it, it's not real\" is a dangerous lens to view through,  yet so many of us do it - including me sometimes.  It's very very difficult to understand someone's personal decision when it comes to mental health and MAID.     but imagine the person having to live this way,  and ultimately deciding that their time on this earth is much too painful, and to transistuon peacefully vs a violent method.    It has to be scary,  confusing,   sad,  peaceful,  all at once.   We live in different times.   And with that, comes different ways to transition.    As much as i would love to give OP a hug and say to hang on for another day,   I /we must also respect their wishes and realize that just bc we may not choose this option or understand it,  the person suffering does,  and has decided to go out with  a sense of peace and dignity.OP,  i just rambled on your page and didn't proof read this...   but i just want you to know that you are seen,  heard,  and loved.  I'm sorry this life has caused you to get to this point.   If we oniy could not feel despair,  loneliness,  hopelessness ... and instead  feel seen, heard  and loved.   For who we are.    Life is brutal and beautiful.   Whichever you end up choosing,   I want you to know some random person in Florida has seen you,  and somewhat understands your pain and loneliness.    Again,  wish i could give you a hug.   So please accept my virtual one.       God Speed,  Friend.",

In fact in the very recent past it has been quite hard for people to access given the conditions that needed to be met in order to be granted it. I am not sure if that has changed yet.Also I can\u2019t speak to your situation, but I\u2019m in BC with failed back surgery and I\u2019m on both long-acting narcotics and immediate-release, short acting (dilaudid). If you\u2019re not receiving narcotics for your pain, I\u2019m not sure why not. Have you tried finding a different doctor before going ahead with MAID? I know good doctors are hard to find these days, so I am not making light of your situation. Alternatively, is surgery not an option? Just trying to understand, MAID is a huge step.Personally I don\u2019t believe anyone wants to \u2018end it,\u2019 they just want an end to their pain and suffering.

I know I developed IBS after a few years of back and leg pain that could only be managed with yet more surgeries.Finally getting effective pain treatment, including opiates, helped, a lot! The fact it took nearly 8 years of torture though left plenty of trauma I'll be working through for the rest of my life.As a stranger, I respect your decision, but hope you're able to get appropriate treatment before being pushed towards this final desperate act to escape your pain.

Because you have seemingly healthy people who CAN NOT get a diagnosis or doctor and that\u2019s why they apply and die. That makes it very very sick.I was so bad in 2024 ( especially after a doctor messed up twice) I considered it several times. A simple surgery can actually save me I recently found out. But I can not get it. I was misdiagnosed for 4 years and other problems dominoed from it. Now I have like 5 problems all from that one problem. They have an industry to make money off you with one diagnosis while omitting any others. How could they do this? Kill people for corruption. I have lost most of  my ability to walk because my heel just hurts. My back, knees, hips, body hurts now. I have fluid retention, gained half my original body weight. Injections became a weekly thing at a point, and mind altering medications were a norm. And they misdiagnosed me for something you can just look at someone\u2019s foot and tell, visually with no imaging needed. Bunch of frauds Canadian doctors are. 4 podiatrists, 3 orthopedic surgeons, 2 physiatrists, pain clinic doctors, all frauds. Good thing I found someone from Europe to take a look. Said straight up to me \u201cthey simply don\u2019t have the knowledge\u201dWell what are we doing here?Wasted all these years waiting for more serious illnesses to develop. Now I truly have something unrelated that could destroy me forever and these years were stolen away.Please, hold on and look for justice. The treatment exists in many of the cases, you just can\u2019t get it! I\u2019m not dying anymore. I\u2019ll fight them to the bitter end",

        "text": "I've thought a lot about your post over the last few days & pondered what I would say with as much kindness and thoughtfulness as I could muster. Here's what I came up with:I'll be unpopular & post what everyone should have said to you: that this is not a good idea.My reasoning is 3 fold.Pain is tremendously destructive and I know at least somewhat hollowed out you feel; absolutely, with insane pain and no sleep after awhile you begin to no longer feel human. It's a terrifying place to be at. But pain isn't forever, I know it feels that way. I know in terms of how you look at your near future it will stay that way, but it won't be like this forever. There are alternatives out there, not many and not easy to see or find. But they do exist. You deserve to live and by killing yourself you are stopping all your future opportunities.I've experienced these dark feelings as I imagine most people on this sub have as well. If I had given in to these dark whispers I'd never have met my niece & nephew, never have been able to make my friends smile or be there to help others who are suffering more than I.  You are capable of so much tremendous good and joy, please don't do this to yourself.2. You are letting the bad guys win. The eugenicists that want us all to die off win by us giving in. The Mike Bloombergs of the world and the Andrew Kolodny's. They want us to die, they want us to disappear so they can make it seem like their idea of an opioid and disability free world is possible. We have a duty to live and stand up and go \"Fuck You!\" We are the evidence of the great murder that's been done to millions of good people and if we disappear gently into that dark night, no one will be left to give that reminder.The number one reason for use of MAID is chronic pain. We are being tricked into killing ourselves.Please don't do it.3. It encourages others to follow you. This post has 729 karma, with 168 comments and the majority are saying  \"bon voyage.\" That is immensely disturbing. Because we suffer so much, because we have been so mistreated it's so easy to go \"well if society doesn't want me then I'll go, what am I living for anyways\" and if we start to praise & support each other in that it could quickly become a social contagion.What do you think people who browse this sub but never post will think of all this? It's creating an expectation for what is considered normal behavior and this must not be the case.You are a great person who deserves so much better. Pls Don't let evil win.",

        "text": "Antidepressants work well for many people; not well for others. It all depends on what kind of pain you have and whether you're open to some potential trial and error. They take a few weeks on average to kick in and start working consistently. Unlike opioids, they don't tend to build up tolerance so needing higher doses or having he drug completely stop working is less of a concern.What many people don't realize about antidepressants is that they work by blocking pain signals, similar to opioids. Unfortunately, the name \"antidepressant\" sometimes scares people off by leading them to think that these drugs don't actually treat pain. Not only do they treat pain, but opioids also treat depression. Either type of drug can be used to treat either condition. Some common antidepressants used to treat pain include:Milnacipran - newer SNRI used for nerve pain and fibromyalgiaDuloxetine - common treatment for nerve pain and fibro; affordableNortriptylene - Tricyclic antidepressant used to treat painAmitriptylene - Another tricyclicVelafaxine - SNRI used for neuropathic painBupropion - NDRI used for neuropathic pain",

    "content": "I'm writing this as I'm sitting in the car before my shift. The pain in my leg but more specifically my knee has been unbearable the last few days. I'm 21, I use a cane. I feel embarrassed using it at work. No coworkers have asked me about it. Thank goodness. Because the general manager at my last job was straight up abelist asking if I really needed my mobility aid. I'm lucky to even have this job. I sit and hand out tickets all day. When I'm feeling more able bodied (the pain fluctuates day to day) I'll do simple cleaning tasks. They're very accommodating.I use to have a friend my age that also has a cane. We don't talk anymore cause he basically didn't want to try to understand my dissociative identity disorder. That's already hard to deal with it. I have two partners and they try to help and sympathetic towards me but I'm sick of complaining because it's been a year and nothing has seemingly gotten better. I've gotten tests done and nothing's came back abnormal besides a few small cysts on my spine. The doctors have not even helpful so I had to go with an entirely different organization because Henry Ford keeps fucking me over. They rescheduled my neurologist appointment without asking me which was a day before my gender affirming surgery. They also gave me a hard time about wanting a second opinion.I could hardly walk up the steps today and yesterday. Usually I'm feeling decently in the morning but I feel like I'm gonna break down and cry every other hour because the pain comes back no matter what I do. Even if I lay down for 5 hours. It'll start becoming really bad again within a hour just from trying to cook. I find it so appalling that people think I'm faking this and my mental illness because I would not want to live with this or wish it on someone. I wasn't a very active person to begin with even before the chronic pain. But I just want to do normal things without wanting to tear my body apart. I have a neurologist appointment the beginning of March and I don't have high hopes because I'm not even sure what could be done. I would feel so much better if I just got a diagnosis and knew what was wrong with me.",

It's usually diagnosed by eliminating other possibilities, but visiting each specialist and some of their testing each causes more pain. So I've given up in the hopes of progress in the future.

He\u2019s such a hard worker + always does his best to help me out when he can. The only thing is, his favorite way to have fun is to go out to hardcore concerts at small local venues. I just wish I could go with him so bad. He goes to one almost every week and it bums me out so bad that the only reason I can\u2019t go with him is because he says they don\u2019t have any seating or safe places to be in if you\u2019re in a wheelchair. I\u2019m autistic so I\u2019ve always been shit at making friends. Id totally go out with them instead while he went out but sadly I\u2019ve just never been very social.

We WANT the pain to stop, or at least controlled enough so that we can participate in the things that DON'T make us feel that way..... most of us WANT to work,  we WANT to be able to do our own shopping, cleaning,  etc.  We WANT to spend time enjoying our place on the planet.  We want the pain to die..... and we want to be heard with compassion because yes, if we are left with nothing but pain why would we WANT to continue this way.  My heart goes out to all of us.

Sympathetic nerves fibers can sprout into the Dorsal Root Ganglion, release multiple mediators for pain like Cytokines and Histamine(which makes the pain feel like itch all the time.) I looked at as a \ud83c\udf33 sprouting roots trying to make a connection. As Nerve Growth Factor also plays a part in this, too.Another thing I learned recently, even searching and reading books in the library around America, was that prolonged injury and less activity in the neurons will lead  to a higher chance for sympathetic nerves sprouting. So, physical therapy IS important as well as activity. That's why Athletics don't have chronic pain from injuries even if they lose a limb. Although that's complex to explain rn on reddit. I myself never did physical therapy and just waited to heal and stopped playing due to the world getting locked down.",

    "content": "If you\u2019re deciding to wean off all your oxy, the number one side effect will be Stabbing like symptoms in your stomach. You\u2019ll feel like you must be dying, you\u2019re not, it\u2019s your intestines cramping and squeezing and it will feel like a knife wielding demon is trying to make its way out. I thought my spine surgeon must\u2019ve cut something in my stomach after the 360 spinal fusion, because, I now have this giant scar on my stomach, because I chew tums for upset stomach , he said it must be a pre-existing condition and I should go to the ER, I asked his assistant, the lady who gave me the meds, :Could it be the medications that I\u2019m weaning off, is this a side effect? She said no. 3 ER visits later, two of whom insisted on giving me a concoction of pain killers, the pain went away they sent me home, third hospital I was not letting them give me pain meds, and the stabbing sensations were horrific, long story short, they took my gallbladder, they didn\u2019t need to but I had insurance and they tricked me into giving consent, it made them money and after the surgery they gave me more pain killers, hence the pain went away. F that hospital. Suck it up, when your weaning off, it will hurt, stay home, don\u2019t let them take parts of you, drink lots of fluids, gatoraides, pedilite, chicken broths, just a couple of days that will feel like an eternity.but it was so worth it. It took me years to feel normal again. Now I\u2019m back to Pain, kind of like before the surgeries, but, I have my wits. I just can\u2019t do anything and my back and legs and feet hurt 24/7. In January I have to have another spinal fusion and I\u2019m sure it will all repeat itself, but, I currently can\u2019t live the way I\u2019m living so, at least they are doing something. Instead of denying it for years. After three back injuries, in January, this will be my fourth spinal surgery since 2008. Hope it\u2019s worth it.",

Started the pain management stuff a little less than a year ago and I'm still looking for something to bring down the pain, I don't need it to be at 0 but I do need it to be at a level to where I can function and not like a 8 in the afternoon where I can't get out of bed.

They pharmacy didn't know that I had asked at my last appointment to up from 7.5 to 10, and the doctor approved just said to call when it was time for a refill and remind them.So I called on Dec 26th, talked to the nurse, and she said she would get it sent in asap.My dad went to pick up my meds on Friday the 27th, and when he brought them, I had a full bottle of 7.5s and a full bottle of 10s.Of course, since they left their control, the pharmacy can not take them back. So I just called my Dr office to inform them. I didn't want to run into problems when I don't need a refill for 60 days instead of 30.So it seems it's either feast or famine.",

Morphine is something that comes in so many different forms, its not likely even with the artificially DEA created opioid shortage. The DEA is quite aware of these shortages, since they created them, and their answer seems to be cutting production. That helps shortages. I wont get in to the whole mess, but in 2019 the DEA got the power to make production cuts at a whim instead of the end of year surprise normally associated with setting production limits.But morphine isnt a drug that should ever be out of stock. Hydrocodone is the same strength as morphine, I'd sure expect that to be in shortage status, but morphine? Not likely.Prior authorizations is a thorn in everyones side. Docs hate them. If you didnt need the freaking Rx the doc wouldnt have written it. Its in their formulary as covered by insurance, so whats to approve? Think about how much money an insurance company has at their disposal. A half hour's interest on such a sum would be  considerable.Thats why they create artificial delays in Rx approval. If the insurance makes it a big enough pain in the ass, lots of patients say \"screw the meds, theyre not worth the trouble\", exactly what the insurer hopes.To get a PA, you have to go through the doctors office. Thats right the same doc that wrote the Rx to begin with. The insurance probably has a (cheaper) preferred drug. So your doc has to explain why youre being put on an expensive drug like  buprenorphine, when Tylenol w/Codeine is pennies per pill....There's no way youre going to get your doc over the weekend? Even if you did, it would still take a couple days for the insurance side of the PA. If you could get a straight answer from the pharmacy, is the morphine Rx still valid? It would have been more time effective if you could get the Rx transferred to a pharmacy that has morphine.Youre allowed 1 (one) transfer between pharmacies on a controlled substance. Its a fairly new rule by DEA, so expect resistance. I was going to send you the link for the law but DEA's servers are down, atm. Those people cant get nothin right.So here an article about the law, its got a link in it to the actual law itself.It may be too late if they voided the morphine Rx, the PA for buprenorphine is a different deal....The majority of pharmacists are full of shit. Lurk in some of the pharmacy groups if you ever want a collection of people that doesnt like people, thats the place. Assholes. Now youre going to tell me you used to be a pharmacist, right? They really are not nice people. Using the word \"sadist\" is NOT out of line, but paranoia fits as well.Everybody is drug seeking according to them and most wouldnt understand a medical condition with a roadmap but they want to overrule your doctor...I would suspect the original trouble, of being out of morphine, is bullshit. They certainly didnt bother calling another store to see if they had your medication in stock. A pharmacist will tell another pharmacist if they have a drug in stock, but they sure as hell wont tell you. You might be a pharmacy bandit. So they could have been a huge help but instead, you got run around. Bringing us to the buprenorphine issue. Thats your insurance. They do it to every drug, Ive had it done to blood pressure meds, all generics. And your doctor and their staff hate it as much as you do. But its standard now. They want you to get fed up, and if you die early, without your Rx, I guess they wont be paying many more medical bills for you. There's people dying for health insurance, they wont run out.Hang in there. I hope when you finally get it, that the buprenorphine works for you. Its not your normal opioid analgesic. I suspect your doctor choosing a lower scheduled drug than morphine is more related to paperwork and regulations than any replacement for your morphine. Their office could call buprenorphine in. I also believe with a lower scheduled drug, you can go to paper Rx's, just in case the pharmacy is suddenly out of Buprenorphine too. I may be wrong RE that, or it may depend on your state laws.Depending on what drug it is (if its a brand drug like Belbuca) you should check their website, they can save big bucks on copays.Unfortunately theere's not much youre going to be able to do thats not going to take a few days to get your meds. The PA doesnt just have to generated by the doctors office, but then the insurance  needs to approve it. I think, by law, they have 72 hours to respond to the PA. The insurance company doctor, will need to evaluate your needs, and carefully review the similar drugs available, before they suggest Morphine Sulfate.....",

There are hundreds in development, with expedited 96-well arrays (calcium imaging, ELISAs, etc) and the recent increase in human tissue GWAS/transcriptomic/proteomic studies to identify a target in humans and backtranslate it into an animal model.However, the process of identifying a suitable target, making the drug orally bioavailable (because injections aren't sexy), and showing sufficient efficacy in preclinical and clinical trials takes 12-17 years, with the additional complication of demonstrating no extrapyramidal/psychological/motor/sympathetic symptoms  if it crosses the BBBalong withsignificantly 'improved' pain metrics in a mixed patient pool.Beyond that, your clinician either needs to: 1) had enough patients with different etiologies to understand which ones will likely respond to the new treatment, 2) listen to you when you make your case for trying the new therapeutic, and 3) justify its use over cheaper existing therapeutics to insurance, especially if you don't have an obvious physical pain source like cancer or a bulging disk.",

Ive been on morphine without a dose change, but multiple people thinks (as well as my GI, excepy my other specialists) morphine is only or majorly the cause of this.Im contacting my pharmacist tomorrow see if we can do a trial period where I dont take any morphine see if it \"resolves\". Im expecting a world of hurt though, and knowing its going to be days if not a week.. Im scared.  Expecially since its the only thing that has been working so far.Cause taking 10+ laxatives to go is nuts. I personally dont think its opioid induced constipation, if not a little. but for it to just be OIC I dont believe that. but it needs to be done cause else my GI will dismiss me again and say \"its just IBS and drop the narcs\". I've been waiting a call from my pain clinic.. fof 2 years now. (HSD/Heds is typically 5 years..)",

It's not magic but they help a ton. Especially Doxepin, cause it helps a lot with sleep.Don't rush it.

        "text": "Opioids  put the twitching action or your GI tract (called peristalsis) to sleep. Bowel doesnt twitch, stool doesnt move unless acted on by more volume. Thats why sometimes you can get a bowel movement with stool softeners but its only the sheer volume of the stool above it that allows movement. Its not necessary to stop your morphine to see if the cause is opioids, which it likely is. They make lots of drugs that are very short acting mild relatives of narcan, the \"opioid antidote\" You feel like  a slight bit of withdrawal for 2 or 3 hours enough to get your bowels moving at least. Movantik, Relistor, theres a few others. Your pain doc probably has a locked room full of samples. BUt if those dont work, you gots other issues than typical OIC. And you dont have to be stripped of your pain control to find out. Or resolve it, if it is OIC..Its actually pretty easy,a doctor should know about these drugs just from Movantik TV commercials. You dont have to go through acute withdrawal, but if you dostock up on the toilet paper your bowels will work too well. Maybe some buttwipes too, after the 28th time, even the softest TP feels like steel wool....",

My husband of a bit more than a year (together for 3.5 years) is not officially diagnosed a chronic pain patient but we\u2019re certainly headed in that direction. More context provided below, but I\u2019m curious what folks would say they truly want from their partners in terms of support with their chronic pain issues. I have read a lot about caregiving as a professional in the field and as someone who has cared for terminally ill family members more than once, so I don\u2019t feel I need advice on how to cope myself. I\u2019m looking for your honest thoughts on what has been or would be most helpful from your partner. Thanks for any thoughts \ud83e\ude77Context: husband is 44M, 6\u20193\u201d and 200lbs and has been around that for a decade or so. Has always had low back pain he attributed to his height, also has a long history of depression/anxiety, distant history of self harm. He is not medicated, had bad experiences with virtually every category of medication in his early 20s and now unfortunately will not try anything else. Recently had a year of mystery symptoms including a fair amount of pain that was finally diagnosed as decompensated arrested hydrocephalus and he had a relatively minor (as far as these things go) brain surgery to drain the fluid about 3 months ago. Surgery went great, a ton of symptoms resolved within days. Since then his back pain has gotten much worse. Impossible to say if this is an increase in pain or if he is simply able to recognize it now that the hydrocephalus symptoms aren\u2019t dominating everything. He just started PT, we\u2019re maxing out OTC NSAIDs/tylenol on a rotation schedule that I\u2019m managing to ensure appropriate dosing. He also uses lidocaine roll on (doesn\u2019t like the patches), ice, and heat. Has tried to increase activity lately per PT advice, but walks of more than a mile just increase pain at this point. His pain is increasing his depression and self-harm thoughts, but no SI yet. I\u2019m worried and researched intensive outpatient therapy programs since he is absolutely opposed to hospitalization or partial hospitalization for the self-harm thoughts. He\u2019s still hoping PT and once a week talk therapy will help.",

        "text": "I\u2019m 32F and my husband is my caregiver. It\u2019s honestly really tough. And he goes through burnout a lot because he also works full time since I can no longer work and is disabled. We can\u2019t afford someone to take care of me, so he does and I always feel bad, and like a burden :(Mental health struggles like anxiety, depression, and SI is common and to be expected when you\u2019re in pain 24/7 365 days. If you have mental Illnesses (I also have CPTSD w/ psychotic features), it makes the struggle harder.Honestly, therapy is a hit or miss when it comes to chronic pain because it doesn\u2019t take the pain away but for some people it can help with mental health struggles. PT doesn\u2019t always help and can make some chronic conditions worse. :( Saying all this based off of experience.Has he gone to pain management yet? Maybe they can give him more than just NSAIDs and Tylenol because they do nothing for chronic pain. Maybe and hopefully stuff like gabapentin, lyrica, baclofen, flexeril, etc. can help ease the pain off a bit for him? But, he needs to get through pain management.First and foremost, take care of yourself. But, you communicated that you have coping mechanisms already so that\u2019s good! As a partner, just do your best to be there for him through the ups and downs because chronic pain is well, chronic. There will be good low pain days and bad high pain days. And everyday is different. Maybe you guys can do stuff together that dont aggravate his pain a lot. Help distract him from the pain. Make a list of activities/coping skills he CAN still do to distract him while in pain and refer back to that list.  Or just hug/kiss/hold his hand while he\u2019s in pain, so he can feel something good besides the pain.For example, one thing I appreciate my husband doing for me is  he drives me to the forests and mountains once a month(I can no longer drive and used to be an outdoors person, but can\u2019t do much anymore because of pain). He knows I love being around trees. Like yeah, I\u2019m still in pain 24/7 but at least I\u2019m with some beautiful trees now instead of doctors and in bed. Lol.Sorry for the ramble. But, I think you\u2019re doing a good job so far. Keep it up \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\ude4f",

        "text": "For me, you are already doing a lot of what I would want. I want someone who accepts me and doesn\u2019t judge, and you sound like you are already doing that. The fact that you work in healthcare (I used to also) and can understand that aspect of his condition is a definite plus. I guess don\u2019t look at him as a patient and not your husband??? And as a practitioner, it is easy to think you know what is best (and you probably do!) but he needs to decide what is the right course of treatment for him. But being supportive, present, loving, and nonjudgemental. That is what I would want.However, he needs more meds imo. Tylenol and NSAIDs can be good, but he should try some other things. I didn\u2019t have good luck with gabapentin/lyrica, but he might. And an antidepressant like Cymbalta may do double duty for him. I am on opioids thankfully and they have changed my life. I know not everyone is as \u201clucky\u201d but you gotta do what you gotta do. As far as the self harm, been there too. It\u2019s hard when your life as you know it falls apart. He needs to talk to someone. I went to an intensive outpatient thing and personally hated it, but make sure he is in therapy. And if you can find him some sort of group to join, chronic pain or chronic illness, that helped me so much. Knowing you are not alone when you feel like no one in the world understands is priceless.Best of luck to you both!!",

        "text": "This may sound like a hot take, but bear with me a sec. I just gave this same advice to another poster asking a similar question.Getting what you want from your partner doesn't matter unless you're getting what you need from yourself. That's because no amount of understanding from you will be enough to help him get to where he wants to be mentally (it would lead to co-dependence if you tried, which usually doesn't make for a healthy relationship). It sounds like your husband has been through absolute hell. I imagine that's understandable taken a toll on him mentally. The fact that you already consider yourself his caregiver means that you're putting a lot of energy into the relationship that you don't expect to be reciprocated. This is not to suggest that your husband should try to operate outside of his limitations, but on your side of the marriage, acting as a caretaker can drain you after several years have gone by.The most impactful thing he can do is put his mental health first. Not only does that help him, but it also helps to set up a relationship for longevity by showing you that while he values and appreciates your emotional support, he's not 100% reliant on it. People get tired after a while if they feel like they're carrying too much of the other person's emotional load, we're all only human. If he's open to it, I'd strongly suggest him finding a therapist that he really clicks with. Doing so can help him to make sense of his diagnoses, strengthen his coping skills, define what he wants from the relationship, and formulate the best plan to communicate with you. I'll include a list oflow-cost and free therapy resourcesthat you can check out if you're interested.",

I do however think on a daily basis that I do want to die. I don\u2019t want to be negative I really don\u2019t. I\u2019m here when anybody needs me even when inside my head im screaming in pain. I love my family & friends even though I rarely see them. I try to find positive things to say to myself yet my reality is, I just want to die & have this all over with.",

Lower back pain, bladder pain, pelvic floor pain, hip labral tear, and constant burning nerve pain from the waist down to my feet.  Dozens of tests and scans with no real answers and apathy from the doctors.  Now they're all telling me to get a hip replacement but I'm terrified that this awful pain I'm in could get even worse and I'm doubtful it will fix anything.I am also losing hope and wondering if I'm just going to remain this hollow shell.  I can't do anything without painful consequences, even just sitting at my desk to work takes a toll.  But some days I just say to hell with it, pop a bunch of pills so I can go out and do something adventurous and feel like the old me again for awhile.  I know I'll pay for it later, but I cling to those little moments of peace.  I always take lots of photos of my outings so that when I'm laying in bed and miserable I can look at them and feel a bit of happiness.",

I have four kids and my wife and I were looking forward to the post-vasectomy life, but at the moment that's not possible. My urologist didn't want to help, but I found a great pain specialist who's really trying to help.I have had a few periods of great depression, feeling another one coming. But the thing I keep telling myself: it's just pain. It could be so much worse. Usually pain is a warning from something worse underneath, but that's not the case here. It's just pain. Feeling pain doesn't mean I shouldn't be doing something or that I'm about to make something worse. It's just pain.Everyone that knows just cringes when I tell them what's wrong.

(Did not ask for them at all btw lol)Im usually using about 18 tablets  out of a box of 20 over the course of 3 weeks  but these last few bad weeks ive used 25My flare ups have been unbearable,  i actually used 3 of my tablets in just a few hours to find relief, my illness is very up and down i will go for periods of time where my flareups are more managable and then back to periods where the flareups are completely unmanagable, i often have to call my mum for help.My doctor mentioned she was a little worried about how much of my medication i have used and that we should wait till next week for a refill   which is no problem to me, but i was a little confused why she then prescribed me so much medication, Is she trying to test me to see if im a pill popper?  (theres a chance she thinks i only have 4 pills left due to slight language barrier and my mumbling)Should i be worried? i went for years enduring pain at home or visiting the ER when its unbearable. Now that i can treat myself at home in a way i feel like a criminal. \ud83d\ude1e",

        "text": "It can be helpful to keep a paper notebook pain-triggers-medications-subsequent pain levels diary.If you are detailed enough, this can help you figure out if your medication use is trending upwards over time, or if your triggers are causing more pain over time, or if your triggers have changed/increased (for example if reaching forward straight ahead now causes pain whereas it used to be you had to twist and reach forward to cause pain).Sometimes MDs will attribute increased pain medication use to \"tolerance\" building.  Sometimes this might be correct.  Other times it might be a physical cause.  Or it might be, with pain medication you did more, but the effects of that linger longer than the pain medication, so your nerves are more sensitized because they were physically irritated while you were using analgesia.  What I'm saying is, there can be multiple reasons and a detailed pain diary can help with this.So can a period of low activity and low triggers, and see if your pain levels and medication intake resets to where it was, or if it continues high.So can a period of toughing it out and building muscle, and see if *that* reduces pain medication intake.So can getting treatments and then seeing if long term the pain medication intake, and logged levels, decrease, or if the regions feeling pain decrease.Sometimes the mind and memory can play tricks.  And, due to how MDs talk amongst themselves, and due to articles that try to shift the root cause of unexplained pain onto patients' minds rather than onto something about the body that isn't yet understood by medicine, MDs can be primed to suspect carelessness, or \"belief\" rather than physical reality, in patients' pain, so a paper diary really helps make the pain \"concrete\" for MDs.  I think in part this is a matter of delivering the documentation in a concrete form.  I suspect that it translates to an understanding that \"oh this is real\".I am basing this partly on domain knowledge of how art & information & informational objects are received differently when they are delivered differently, because that's my field.I will also mention, I take a 1/4 cupful of nutritional supplements every day to prevent tolerance from building up.  I will also mention that tolerance can even build from NSAIDs.  It would help to know what your Rx is, but if you are curious about my list, I can share it.  You would have to check the list against your existing conditions to make sure you can take whatever you might want to try, of course.",

Walking around cramps are 3-4 pain level after 5 yrs I\u2019ve learned to deal with it. When they jump up to 8-10 is when I start screaming and can\u2019t handle it. Well you last MRI didn\u2019t show anything else. Xrays don\u2019t show anything either. Ok doc it\u2019s been 6 months since the last MRI let\u2019s do one more. He finally hesitantly agrees but says I don\u2019t know what it will accomplish but ok. Do the mri and finally he see I have arthritis in the joints where the nerves run out to my legs in L3, L4, L5, S1. His first thing he says is I want to apologize to you as soon as I saw the MRI I saw it and realized your still have to be in tremendous pain because from what I see the joints are only open about a 1/3 of what they are supposed to be. I say why are you apologizing he said I really thought you were faking or it was just in your head! Can you believe that crap? I was pissed!",

        "text": "I have actually been learning and it is not categorically true that most physical therapy is  set up to make you better. Many are designed to make sure it will not help kuch if anything or anyone in the long run besides their profit  and the patient losing money.  A physical therapist should be in fact pushing people to the limits with in their capacity. They should not just be  allowing a patient to do the bare minimum whole they attend to one than one client.I have seen too many PT where I have to tell them they are not doing their job and get off their phone. Light stretching and riding a bike for ten minutes is not how PT should be. They are also supposed to teach you exercise to make you independent so that you don't need to pay weekly, sometimes twice three time weekly co pays. However, my experience is they want you coming back forever.Many of these PT places are tied directly to big hospitals and if you fail they recommend surgical consult. Which is insane because the PT program most likely failed to provide adequate service and then call the patient a failure.Most times if you 'fail' PT they recommend a surgical consult (maybe pain management as well) with the hopes of chopping you open for some surgery that may or may not work or may leave you wrecked for life. The hospitals and places affiliated (imaging centers / pain management) profit hugely by this.It's sad as many people think PT doesn't work and it very well may not for most people. The real problem is most people never have even been to real physical rehabilitation or therapy even if they went to a high end hospital affiliated physical therapist and did everything they were supposed to.Note: there is real physical therapy/rehabs out there and not all practices are shit. However, MANY are set up to take your money and keep you in the system by either extended useless PT or referring you to a clinic/hospital where both the PT and referral place profit.I also don't think the 'realest PT' is the answer for everyone. After all in order to work out I literally need drugs or it's not happening. I am lucky mushrooms provide enough pain releief to allow me to work out or I would not even be able to do anything close besides light stretching on most days.",

(Acupuncture has a decent track record for helping immediately with spinal nerve pain (which sciatica is), and PT should help in the longer term alleviate the stress on your spine.I wouldn't normally make medical suggestions, but if you're at the end of your rope I think they could be worth a try (unless you've tried that route already).",

I\u2019m not done yet but I\u2019ve been off most medication for a few weeks now.All he is doing is stretching me and teaching me what to do. And also building up my glutes.For the first time in years I feel I might get my life back.So basically 1. Nerve block when it\u2019s really bad and 2. Stretching and muscle building",

As opposed to being frivolously traumatized,  of course.  ;)Its like when folks don't understand deep grief. I often tell folks be thankful you don't understandSometimes I try to give an analogy...my single biggest source of pain right now is the severe arthritis in my ankle...on good days its like stepping on a nail or Lego brick when I'm laying down. Most folks can relate to Legos.  Well, parents anyway.And I am often surprised at how much one source of pain can be masked by others. Again not that the bar for understanding is all that high.It would be a great super lower to have, being able to share what we feel...if we could control when. How would it impact everything if any time anyone got near you or touched you, they got hammered by whatever it is afflicts you?

But if there are communication issues it doesnt tell anyone WHY \"Mr. Yuk\" is a better choice over \"Pacman\".Descriptors help, but think about your poor doctor for a minute, every time they ask about your pain, they have to go through their notes to find your pain scale and look up how you feel. Its got as much value as the 1-10 scale, it just requires a \"key\" now.  Thats not going to make things clearer.The shading body diagram is great for location but with the pain scale, we are taking about severity.  Unless you use crayons and add a color key for intensity of pain, this choice is a bit of a misfit for a pain scale. Location is important too, dont get me wrong. But its a totally different issue from pain severity.I had a feeling you saved the best for last. Talking to your doc is the best way to quantify and qualify your pain. Also consider the effects of the pain when describing your condition, like you cant reach the Capn Crunch cereal on the top shelf. Give examples of how the pain interferes on a daily basis. Thats the best way to get things across, The doc has likely had occasions where they cant reach the Capn Crunch too. They may not experience the same degree of pain reaching for the cereal, but its an \"activity\" that most folks can relate to. You just have to make it clear how severe the pain is when you reach for the cereal. An \"8\" just doesnt get that done. Doctors use mild, moderate and severe. You may want to add \"call 911\" to that scale, but more than that is silly. You have seen the movie \"Spinal Tap\"? The scene with the amplifier thats so special, because it goes to 11, where all the other only go to 10. Funny bit, if you havent seen the movie, but its funny cause its silly. Just like telling a doctor your pain is an \"11\"....",

I had lost the weight, did the exercise, the physio and appeased the people I needed to by doing \u2018pain management\u2019. But I\u2019m still on a heavy concoction of pain relief that I need to be able to actually function and parent. I have a great Dr who is equally frustrated with how much push back her referrals get and we work together with weaning off the opioids and even though it\u2019s slow, she gets it. I knew something wasn\u2019t right and feel so angry orthopaedic didn\u2019t pick up on the fact that my screws have moved. I had to take it upon myself to go and get another X-ray and CT scan and ask my Dr to send them a side by side. It seems the screw is probably sitting on my sciatica nerves. It wasn\u2019t normal to be in more pain than 3 years ago, I\u2019m losing strength in my legs and the shake when I put pressure on them, I wake up in pain, I\u2019m creating a slipped disc in my back from the posture of how distributing my weight.I\u2019m only in my early 30s, I have a 3 year old with extra needs and is just so physical strong and demanding and I have no family support. It\u2019s so easy for orthopaedics to just dismiss and throw me to pain management and for them to gaslight me, telling me the pain is all in my head or when you\u2019re more stressed you feel it more. Well it\u2019s not, there is bits of metal moving in my body to where they shouldn\u2019t. Just really tired of falling through the crack and knowing I won\u2019t be heard. I absolutely know I\u2019m not an emergency case and I fall way to the bottom of the triage list but I would like some quality of life without constantly reaching for the pills.Thanks, Just needed a space to let that out.",

Had a revision fusion done with internal titanium fixation hardware. Weeks after revision I got severe pain over surgical site, xrays looked good. Surgeon had a radiologist injected lidocaine into one side of pedicle screws, within 10 mins all left side pain was gone. #6 was to remove titanium hardware. The surgeon said that screws were tight and rods in place, I am one of the 3% who are sensitive to titanium. 10 yrs after my successful revision fusion, L3-4 ruptured without injury, and my left side SI Joint was bone on bone due to failed laminictomies. I was warned that having a fusion could create issues with other vertebrae. OP, good luck, I  would think your hardware allowed bones to heal/fuse back. Hopefully, all is well, and metal can be removed. You've been through enough pain!!!",

        "text": "Omg i feel you so much. My x-ray looks so similar. Double fracture of my sacrum. My pain started after i started to move more and more. It went away and came back with immunsuppressing drugs, three times. The last time, after a long walk it, it came back and never went away, no matter how much and long i was taking the corticosteroids. When they removed the metal, the pain got even worse.Doctors think its because the hematomas, which developed during surgery and after \"exercise\", are producing pressure on my nerves = nerve pain.Well, now the hematomas arent visible in the x-ray anymore. Still, the pain remains. Without any nerve damage during the first surgery.Im not even in a pain management regimen (in the process of getting there), but i feel your frustration.Im on 120mg Oxycodon and 300mg Pregabalin daily. Came down from 160mg oxy and 450mg lyrica...I was a very athletic person before my accident. Im 21 and now i struggle with pain daily, not even knowing the exact reason.And this is the top of my the physical burden i carry... Chronic gastritis, leaky gut, nerve pain in my arms, HIT and MCAS ... The next great achievement i got within the last months is ME/CFS and a totally fucked up immunesystem. Tbh rn the chronic pain i carry every day isnt even the worst. The undiscribale fatigue and the immune reactions which come with ME/CFS overweight my pain at the moment.Diagnosed with depression a month ago. Waiting for clinical treatment.A thousand illnesses + severe addictions + depression ... and this brilliant combination at the age of 21. \"It only gets worse\" is what my experience of life is right now.But. Maybe it might help you just a little bit. Always remember: it can always be worse.I know thats not a solution to your problems, neither to mine, we both have much to carry and much to go trough in order to arrive at a point of \"quality of life\", but its very important not to lose your positive attitude. Even at the worse fucking point of your life.I thought a year ago my life is bad, now its even worse. Despite all the pain and sorrow: enjoy what you have! Because: it can always be worse.Maybe you might want to read this poem:poem from keanue reeves \"ode to happiness\"",

I have had two surgeries, the first one put four screws in and a few years later (when it still hurt) he added three more. I've since had second opinions who want to take the screws out and seemed actually baffled at the first surgeon's choice. This has been going on since 2010 so honestly I've known more of my life now than I did without pain and that gets so depressing sometimes. I'm a nurse so I am on my feet for 12hr shifts sometimes with minimal breaks. I basically just have to function on autopilot, disassociate from the pain. It's terrible and has brought my quality of life down to almost nothing on the really bad days. I have an appointment with a pain management after years of accepting this as my reality on the 30th so, wish me luck.",

However, I know they\u2019re not recommended to get more than a couple times as they can cause muscle breakdown and some other issues I\u2019m not as familiar with. I\u2019d say it\u2019s safe to try it once if your doctor says it\u2019s ok but if the pain comes back I probably wouldn\u2019t do it again. Also if your pain isn\u2019t caused by inflammation there\u2019s really no point. Another thing is for me personally the injection was really painful although it went away within half an hour. This may have been because it was injected into my wrist though, not sure about other parts of the body.",

If this is the fucking Hoop I have to jump thru, than Fine, lets get to fucking jumpin. If anyone is interested in joinin up for strength in Numbers, Im open to that too. (NOT a lame 'hook up ploy', lets make THAT Crystal CLEAR, Lol ) But otherwise I have no issue with grouping together and help each other save some money, etc. But going alone is NO Issue, either. I'm a combat Vet, 60 yo, and not exactly introverted, lol. But I'm only an asshole if I'm left with no other options, generally speaking. I just want to live out my years in reasonable 'comfort', and be able to do the things that interest me, until my last breath. Right now, thats not happening as it should be, and I'm over it.I've heard Colombia, Argentina, etc, and Mexico,and Costa Rica/Dominican Repub.  Also  Europe, places like Czech Repub., and Portugal, Switzerland, and Netherlands, of course.Anyone have ANY recent idea if any of these are legit, and if so, who or where to go to find out more info.  I'm an experienced traveler and a Vet, so I'm not stupid, or childish, and I certainly don't look or act 'sketchy' or like a tweaker or anything weird, so I'm not worried about any of that side of it- ALL comments welcome, let me hear from you.CLEARLY, NO ONE IS COMING TO SAVE US. So it IS what it IS.  And thats FINE W Me. I only need these assholes to get the fuck out of my GD way, and I would be fine, now, FFS.  Smfh. I think I'm MOST pissed at these asshole setting them selves up as the High & Mighty Gatekeepers, and now we find out MOST couldn't keep their hands off all that SWEEEET PHARMA CASH and pushed all kinds of shit on all kinds of folks that shouldn't have ever been pushed on, and NOW they are all pissin themselves, praying they don't get 'found out' so NOW 'DRUUUGS ARRRE BAAAAD MMKAY KIDS !!'WELL, FUCK THEM. HARD. I'm*NOT* GONNA KEEP SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THEIR WEAK WILLS.Anyway, thats the plan until I find out anything that makes this not possible.",

        "text": "Colombia, Ecuador, Peru still have actual opioid pain meds available and some are available otc. Dominican Republic also from what I have read. Parts of northern India produce medical opium which would probably be the least toxic and most effective but might be a challenge to live there and procure. This is a pathetic and stupid problem, many of us will never feel normal without opioid pain meds. Opioids are one of the oldest and most effective substances mankind has utilized to improve our quality of life or to recover from injury. 5000 years of historical usage. People that do not have chronic pain don\u2019t seem to be-able to grasp a couple of key considerations. One is most chronic pain patients don\u2019t experience any euphoria when they take opioids, they feel normal, you can alter your levels of consumption depending on how bad your pain is you don\u2019t always need to take the maximum amount or keep increasing your dose.  Most chronic pain patients will reach a stable prescription dose and stay on roughly the same dose for years. In my case I don\u2019t need to take them everyday in the summer but as soon as the temp drops below freezing I have to have them daily to function normally. Many high functioning individuals would not have been able to preform in society if they were not on opioids. JFK was on huge levels of narcotics while dealing with some of the most difficult times in recent history. Just to name one. This is just another example of how unbridled greed has ruined a high functioning system. The same thing has happened to basically every aspect of our lives, housing, it\u2019s not just where you live instead it\u2019s been turned into a twisted greed factory where it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to rent out your closet for a couple hundred bucks any time and anywhere you feel like it because people are so desperate for shelter, vehicles prices are such that you never actually own your car you basically rent it for $1000 a month forever. Medical care is not about your health it\u2019s about money and greed. Food isn\u2019t about taste and nutrition, it\u2019s about money and profit. Don\u2019t be surprised to see a huge pro communism movement about the time trump leaves office if he does. There is no value in American life, it is all monetized, metered, buffered and gamed.",

Anytime you procure a narcotic medication without going through legitimate channels of having it prescribed by a doctor, you risk receiving something adulterated.

If you plan to pursue this, you should go in with the expectation that you won't receive legitimate pharmaceuticals and everything you take can pose an OD risk due to illicit fentanyl.

Several Hospitals, including the VA,where I go, NOW have it as written Policy. All the Facts in the World no longer make any difference, Hence my very serious questions about options Abroad.Not being snarky at all, but its just no longer relevant here, sad to say. When I complained to Patient Advocacy at the VA, while the guy I spoke to was very nice and sympathetic, its just a Done Deal. He even told me that they actually caused the Deaths of at least one Elderly FT Resident there,who was in his 90s, by stopping his narcotic meds cold turkey after 30 years. I think he volunteered that to me just to give me an idea of how hopeless it is to even bother, and I can't say he's wrong. If they are willing to do that, because of 'Policy', as opposed to a RATIONAL, 'Case by Case evaluation' - Then there truly is Zero Hope, OR Point in pursuing it further. I was floored he even told me that story, TBH. But I guess what am I gonna do ? Who's gonna believe me,and I don't even have the poor Vet's Name.THIS is the World we are dealing with.",

    "content": "So tomorrow is the big day, my work\u2019s Christmas party ( big place). It\u2019s just a buffet at lunch where 50+ people gather. We all just grab food, sit down, and there\u2019s very little chit chat. Mostly just HR talks about the year, anniversaries and calls for prizes.But, we go by foot. It\u2019s 3 blocks of walking and there\u2019s quite a bit through the buildings too. And going back up is 3 levels of outdoor stairs as we are on a hill. I can repark but it\u2019s still far. There\u2019s no close parking as it\u2019s a massive events building and hotel.Last year I only had limited walking and hip issues. I won a very heavy prize. And I got stuck in the staircase as I missed the exit. I walked too much as company had multiple levels, to claim my prize as well.Overall it hurt me  and I spent the whole Christmas with a flare of sciatica.This year, I also have plantar fasciitis flared up badly, a new back strain, my old tinnitus flare ups are back so I\u2019m sensitive to noise, and voice strain which somehow also came back.Whenever they all hit me like this it\u2019s stress. I\u2019ve stressed about this thing for weeks now.It hurts to sit without a pillow on bar stools. It hurts to hear people yell and cheer from top of their lungs atm, and my feet can\u2019t handle much, I can barely stand more than 1-2 minutes. I use crutches as well on such walks. This winter I can\u2019t climb stairs either. And I certainly can\u2019t shout in the noise to talk to others.How bad is it I just call in sick and don\u2019t go?To make matters worse, there\u2019s another event this week I was.l invited to ( my God, a second work Christmas meetup) but I have an appointment at exactly that time. This forces me to go to the event tomorrow.I can\u2019t miss so much!Plus I\u2019m scared of buffets because they require waiting and standing and some at my work are sick since it\u2019s winter and I\u2019m travelling home in a few days. I want to at least marginally enjoy that.,What do you think? Is my career on the line?We didn\u2019t all meet up in a long time. Lately company events are so rare, but I only missed one in the past. Mental health wise I like being out there so it also hurts not to go but I honestly don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll pull this off.Honestly I\u2019ve been to lots of work events in the past. None have been so on foot and straneous. Plus we\u2019d get food to the tables. Or parking.",

Whatever you need to do to get out of this bc you are clearly creating all these symptoms by stressing yourself out.

And so the pharmacy fills it on day 27-29 of 30- the pharmacy then calls and tells you your script is ready- (mind you-  it doesn't matter when it gets picked up)-  so you get blamed and accused of being an addict for \"filling a script early\" even if you never had a single day off \"extra medication\".... Even better, you're labeled high risk, so your doctor decides to drop you anyway.Oh, sorry if these are detailed. If you can tell, I'm not just coming up with generic examples.",

    "content": "Last night I had an IBS flare that was so incredibly painful it hurt to breathe. I wanted my husband to choke me just so I could stop breathing it hurt so badly. It feels like if not one part of my body is hurting then another part is. I\u2019m never without pain it feels like it\u2019s my default setting. In the thick of the pain last night I was thinking of how I must deserve this pain and do not deserve any relief from it. That somehow I did this to myself and so I must suffer the rest of my life.Does anyone else ever feel like that? I know logically I don\u2019t deserve the pain and I didn\u2019t bring it upon myself but my mind goes there every time and I hate it.",

Every month I'd internally lament about being such a weak fucking baby. I used to be jealous of people with endo diagnoses because apparently I was just cursed with super painful periods for no reason besides being weak. Then the pain became chronic, and after a lot of fighting I had surgery and it turned out I had endo all along lol. It kind of broke my brain. Nowadays I think that God hates me and is torturing me because of like bad karma or something. I feel like there's something ive done to deserve this even tho I know many people who are worse than me and live with perfect health and easy, happy lives. Some days I wrack my brain trying to figure out what sin I need to atone for but I come up with nothing.",

        "text": "Yes my family has a lot of alcoholism. I swore I would never touch it or drugs because of how some of my family behaved. Then I had horrible pain conditions start and my anxiety and depression got worse. I eventually tried alcohol and it made everything go away magically. Eventually the hangovers got to be worse than just suffering without the alcohol but evety once in a while I get to where I have to drink to have a moment of peace even knowing the cost the next day. I now realize how much most of my family was probably self medicating for physical and mental health issues that as a poor person nobody cares about. I've had multiple serious issues that were blatantly ignored by drs until I had to get emergency surgery. Even after the surgery they cut off care for me way quicker than anyone I know. They acted surprised I was exhausted going back to work after a bone tumor shattering my femur after only a month post op. But everyone else I talked to at the clinic got 3 months or more out of work for planned orthopedic surgery not involving tumors. They also don't believe I still have pain in that hip/leg. Like I cannot lay on my right side because it hurts so bad. And my back is now all jacked up so getting comfortable to sleep is damn near impossible. But I always feel like I'm maybe not in as much pain as I feel, that it is all in my head. That I'm just an alcoholic like my family even though I don't drink often. That I caused everything. It's completely insane when I really think about it. But it's hard not to at times.",

        "text": "I feel this way all the time, that I deserve the pain. A lot of my pain is kind of \"my fault\" too because I have GERD and likely fibromyalgia (although I haven't been given an official fibro diagnosis) because only up until a few months ago I consistently ate better and exercised. And still that wasn't enough to prevent the digestive and muscular issues I have now. At the end of the day though, hating ourselves is not a way to live. It helps me to picture my body as the body of someone I love. Because if my loved ones needed physical therapy or medication or accommodations I would be more than happy to help them get their needs met, but when it's myself I tend to feel like who cares what happens to me. Reframing your mindset about health is hard but I promise you that we ALL deserve to feel better. I'm here for you. \u2764\ufe0f",

        "text": "Did you grow up religious? I ask because the idea \"deserving to suffer\" is one that's normalized in a lot of religions. \"I must have done something terrible to deserve this\" might SEEM humble at first glance but it's a real toxic mindset because the moment you start attaching crime and punishment to pain, and use it as an arbiter of justice and reason, you start victim-blaming.Pain is not a morality factor. It's not a punishment for a wrongdoing. It's just a fact of life, how when a deer gets caught in a trap and limps, it does not \"deserve\" pain. A woman does not \"deserve\" pain from having a child, no matter how much patriarchal religious text likes to tell us to justify ignoring women's suffering. You don't \"deserve\" pain for being ill. A therapist can help if you need help getting out of your head a bit.",
