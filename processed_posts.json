I've dealt with this (similar) thing for the last 7 years..\" and she goes \"WhAt!  YoU'rE tOo YoUnG!\", I replied \"I'm actually having back surgery in a couple days. Pain doesn't discriminate and I know it sucks,but you can't just blow up on everyone.\"  she was still a jerk too everyone, but a little less of a jerk to me.At the time I was 24 when I had back surgery.  I'm 31 now and I still get that. Having had this injury for almost half my life now, is what makes me value what I do and it means a lot to patients that I actually DO understand what they're going through.

Afterall I was young, a reasonably healthy weight, and little did she know... an invisible illness.Of course I just sat on the floor after that. She never looked at me to wonder why I wasn't standing and nobody stood up for me for being treated so poorly and singled out on the train.It's always stuck with me and made me afraid to ask for a seat on public transport. Nobody would ever offer me one at 25, even though I often sit on the dirty floor to ensure I can be seated.I'm working on my confidence to be able to ask for a seat!",

        "text": "I'll give you some useful tools that have worked for me.Infrared sauna and red light therapy: both of these have helped a lot with chronic pain especially in the neck, back area, wrists, and feet. Especially in your case this could be something that could drastically benefit you. I noticed that once I started using it In less than a week I noticed massive difference. First I started going to the gym using their infrared sauna. And then later went on Amazon and bought myself and infrared sauna. It's definitely worth it especially if The pain is constant everyday. The red light therapy device i got from redlightman online. if you do plan on using the redlight use some kind of cbd topical with it. Helps ALOTTTT MORE with healing!!! The red light helps the CBD penetrate deeper with the vasodilation and absorption. Can't recommend it enough.Redlight device from: (Redlightman)Ginger extract with bromelain: both of these compounds have a systemic effect on lowering inflammation and is very similar to curcumin which is the main compound found in turmeric. I noticed that my baseline pain is a lot lower now ever since I started supplementing both. I like the brand nutricost and bulk supplements which you can find on Amazon. They have great productsCBD topical and CBD tincture: I noticed that ever since I started using CBD topically and some CBD internally that this has done a drastic shift and helping me deal with pain. I take a CBD pain relief gel topical on my areas of inflammation and pain. And then I take a CBD tincture internally and this helps with systemic inflammation. This combination is truly remarkable. If you do go for the CBD pain relief gel get either the 3000mg or 5,000 mg it's definitely worth it and it lasts you over 3 months. I would say this for sure is my top three go to's for when I'm in pain. Which is almost always lolHighly recommend this combination. The muscle CBD pain relief Gel is from Herbal Garden Essentials . And the CBD tincture I get from Charlotte's Web. I like Charlotte's Web a lot just because they pretty much started the whole CBD movement in Colorado.Last thing I would recommend which is relatively new and it's form for dealing with chronic pain is ketamine therapy. I have used this company called joyous And I use their lozenges That dissolve in your mouth. It's a microdose and it drastically has helped with my mental health and as well chronic pain.Definitely look into the sauna and CBD topical/ Tincture Those two have been a miracle for me. helping take care of the inflammation with the cbd daily can help with healing and recovering.Hope this helps and gives you some kind of direction",

        "text": "Can you get in touch with your old doctor? Maybe they can suggest someone that has actually prescribed an opioid or two in their medical career. They should know not to do this to any patient.I wished there was a bit more notice than a week.The first thing you should do is relax. Have you ever had opioid withdrawal before? Even a little taste? Theres some ways around some of the worst of it. Taper is a big deal so if it looks imminent (with a week it sorta does, just being honest), you may want to break up some pills (make sure its safe, some drugs you cant). A little taper can go a long way.With your heart issues, all these doctors are nuts. Use the ER if you have to, I figure you probably have some sort of monitor app on your watch/phon, if not better monitoring. I wouldnt hesitate.The pain meds youre on are going to matter a lot and doses, etc and so on will determine how severe this will be. I wouldn't ask you to post your drug regemin or location. Maybe Ill drop you a PM too. But it sounds like youve run in to a lot of cracked doctors. Its not you.This doc that said you would have a heart attack? Your cardiologist? Im sure they have a fully functioning DEA prescribing number. Perhaps if you told their nurse and explained what the doctor told you... they might get in trouble, whoever they are, if you have something go awry. They should see it makes much more sense to Rx the needed medications...I wouldnt suggest long use, as there might be a heavy metal issue with it, but are you familiar with the Indonesian herb Kratom? Its a legal opioid at least for the time being, and the legality can vary with your location. But if its a \"break glass in case of emergency\" moment, you might want to explore it. You should be able to detox pretty easily with it. Addicts use it a lot for that purpose. And others.But I think my first step would be trying to contact your old doc. I dont need to go through to whole history of the \"Opioid Crisis\", but there are lots of doctors who know this whole Rx thing is bullshit, its just cover up for the DEA and the \"wonderful\"/s job they have done with street drugs. More deadly than ever, but who's noticed with all the bullshit they put out about RX drugs? Exactly as planned. And paid for. Some people, including doctors, have actually followed the numbers and the money know this Rx opioid garbage is made up. You need to find one of those doctors. Theyre out there. I dont think I'd call 4 docs an extensive search, you can only work with what you have, but maybe widen the area. And try different specialists. Try Anesthesiologists, they do pain sometimes, Try PM&R practices. I find it an insulting term, but they call patients on long term opioid therapy \"legacy patients\". We are a legacy of the opioid crisis, instead of a legacy of the few years during which they actually knew how to treat pain. Either way its insulting.Dont give up looking. Youve seen a primary care and the 3 Stooges. Somewhere along the line, you have to run in to a doctor thats actually read the CDC's opioid prescribing guidelines....Hang in there...",

    "content": "My father has multiple sclerosis and is undergoing disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). He\u2019s been prescribed opioids for chronic pain but refuses to use them. After purchasing cannabis oil (CBD/THC), he decided against using it, worried it might interfere with his MS treatment and lead to complications like brain infections.He\u2019s not willing to consult his doctors, believing any interference\u2014no matter how minor\u2014could jeopardize his treatment. Based on my research, cannabis oil may affect liver enzymes and alter how MS medications are metabolized, potentially reducing their effectiveness.His doctors have prescribed opioids and other strong treatments, suggesting they\u2019re comfortable with potent interventions. This makes cannabis oil appear relatively low-risk from a medical standpoint, though its effects on the nervous system, absorption, and possible drug interactions remain uncertain. I\u2019m continuing to look into it, aiming to better understand its potential benefits and risks, particularly since he\u2019s still young at 53 and has a long life ahead of him.",

If the word hoax doesnt fit better than \"Crisis\", watch it again....And you should trim the front end of the video, Red. I don have suggestion/question if your dont mind? There seems to be an issue where these anti opioid zealots would listen to your evidence and say : \"Yeah, now we dont have any over prescribing of medication, but what about 20 years ago when this all started, doctors RX'ed opioids like candy\" We both know thats crap. It just seems to me that its important, either now or eventually, to expose this all as a plot to get the publics mind off the miserable failure of the DEA in preventing illicit fentanyl poisoning of street drugs across the board.Maybe Im jumping the gun, if you have to explain addiction and dependence to doctors... But it does seem they like to play past and present statistics against each other even when they have nothing but rhetoric as evidence.Well said, as always, Red. This should be a CME course for doctors on telling the difference between addiction and complaint pain patients, treating medical conditions. It shouldnt be necessary.My fear is the CDC and their pals have drained all compassion from medical profession. Its not going to be enough to prove them wrong, you have to make doctors care about relieving pain and suffering again, and I dont know if thats possible. Proving that this whole thing is full of beans, has never been the problem. That was a great inclusion of the AMA opioid policy, betcha that'll shock a lot of people...",

I think the conversation needs to go beyond the statistics to address more effective preventative measures and proactive intervention. Our healthcare system does not screen for addiction risk factors, does not empower patients to be aware of early signs of addiction, and treats addicts so poorly that most would never trust a doctor to help them recover. Our mechanisms to cope with the addicted population are so poor that we project the worst outcome onto everyone. Do you think that would happen if addiction had an effective protocol and cure? The tools exist to counteract addiction, but they occupy the fringes of medicine, casting people out to addiction centers instead of intervening in an earlier stage. Until our response to addiction is addressed, I doubt that statistics will matter much.",

    "content": "To recap, there's been an issue with my urine drug tests the last 2 times(Aug and Nov) I took my meds as I always had, but 1 test(aug) was missing oxycodone. Then next test(nov), it was missing morphine.I was FREAKING out because I have no explanation and I thought they were gunna kick me out.I was determined to make sure my meds show up. So I made sure to take my morphine 3 hours before the appointment and oxycodone 4 and then 2 hours before the appt. I've been so nervous  about this most recent test done on 12/18. I just got the results back.All of my meds showed up!!! There was 1 other variable. I drink an insane amount of lemonade/apple juice mixed. After those 2 off test, I started think maybe something about the acidity was throwing off my levels. So I made sure that I was only drinking water 3 days before the test. Because in my mind: lemonade=fail water=pass. Of course that could also have absolutely nothing to do with it.I'm just so relieved that I could cry. I know this whole thing has been quite the saga so I wanted to update you guys. And thank you for all your advice.I'm all ears if someone has any clue why this happened. And I can absolutely tell you, it was not because I wasn't taking it.ETA- I posted my results in the comments",

        "text": "Apple cider vinegar can be used to detox and help pass drug screens. I imagine a mixture of lemonade and apple juice could give the same result, especially if you drank a lot of it. Apple juice is less potent than apple cider vinegar. Apple juice is fresh apple liquid. Apple cider vinegar is that liquid fermented more (more acid). Lemon is acid. So yeah, mixing apple juice and lemonade and drinking a ton every day could have caused your previous results. You can find recipes for apple lemon based detox drinks online with lots of claims about it. Your dr will probably disagree about it being the cause though.",

When I looked at my notes, I'd shown methadone in a blood test. At the time I was only taking Palexia SR and paracetamol.I asked my GP if anything I was on could have metabolised into methadone and was told no. She also said no anaesthesia would have shown as methadone. I went down a few rabbit holes and discovered methadone is virtually never given in operations. The only possible operation to use it is a complex spinal operation where you need to be conscious but in as little pain as possible.I've never had to do tests for Pain Clinic, and that blood result made me quite worried. I'm in Australia if that helps, and the day surgery was to \"collect\" a stray gall stone that was threatening to block my pancreas.Afaik I wasn't given additional opioids during the hospital visit. There would have been no need.",

I have been with my partner since June, ultimately becoming a LDR as I was forced to move back in with my family due to my condition.The only thing we ever fight about is my illness. All of our fights somehow relate to that. Recently it has been really difficult, blowing up at each other and fighting nearly everyday. I love her so much, I want to build my life with her and I really want to make this work, but as the person with chronic illness I am struggling and looking for advice on how you all handle being in a relationship while dealing with debilitating pain.We have been fighting much more lately because I have been at a terrible low, this is the sickest mentally and physically she has seen me in the six months we have been together. It is hard for me to have fun, show up for her and be a good partner when I can barely do so in my own life and show up for my self. Would love to hear thoughts, stories, advice, thanks.",

        "text": "I just offered this advice to another poster asking a very similar question:This may seem counter-intuitive, but simply trying to improve the relationship is not enough if your mental health is also suffering. That's because no amount of understanding from her will be enough to help you get to where you want to be mentally (it would lead to co-dependence if you tried, which usually doesn't make for a healthy relationship).The most impactful thing you can do is start with your mental health first. Not only does that help you, but it also helps to set up a relationship for longevity by showing her that while you value and appreciate her support, you're not reliant on it. The average person gets tired after a while if they feel like they're carrying too much of the other person's emotional load. Maybe that's where she's at right now. She's suffering too, in her own way, even though it's hard to see because your pain and suffering is greater, the feeling may be ever-present for her, leading to built-up loneliness and resentment. If you're open to it, I'd strongly suggest finding a therapist that you really click with. Doing so can help you to make sense of your diagnoses, strengthen your coping skills, define what you want from your relationship, and formulate the best plan to communicate with your SO. I'll include a list oflow-cost and free therapy resourcesthat you can check out if you're interested.",

Fast forward to the last couple weeks, pain is back to where it was. My doc said we could raise the dose or lower it since I have some side effects. But, I am also kind of out of pain options since I tried gabapentin, physical injections, amitriptyline, protriptyline, etc. I have my medical marijuana card and I use that and it marginally helps. It at least helps me fall asleep.With that in mind do I try to lower or raise the dose?",

I like it. I even posted about it the other day, in support of a different topic. I'm doing that again, in yet another context.What is in the post-title link is part of the DEA's (in this case) rule-making (amending/extending,etc. process) where the  public is invited to peruse  the rule and other details. (Example is in post link.) After that, readers are meant to move on to the public comments section where they are encouraged to write  in their opinions, for example.While there on the main page, looking over at the side bar I notice their tally for number of times read; it had been read  \"0\" (zero) times.Well 'that has to' stop. By that I mean we need to start taking responsibilty for ourselves before we can expect anyone else to follow. We know now that this is a thing, so we need to stay alert for opportunities such as this. I'm not saying nobody does already, but clearly a lot don't participate in saying their piece, where and to whom it matters:*when it might affect policy.*And policy is not our friend lately.Having gotten dv'd already, I'm going to stop right here. I didn't know how best to make a long comment to a post before the post  existed, except like this. Maybe somebody will get my drift. I hope so. I'm just about back-of-an-ambulette material anyway.

My hips normally hurt everyday my legs my back my shoulders my neck. Just this last week my left hip has been in excruciating pain. I have no idea why. I can take a pain pill and it brings the pain down about 50% but it doesn't last very long. I feel like crying everyday. I have an appointment coming up for a physical with a doctor I've never seen before and I'm going to request an x-ray of my left hip because something is definitely wrong. It's not the same pain I have every day it's worse. I can't walk it hurts to bend sitting is a challenge standing up straight is a challenge it's just horrible. I would wait until I see the pain doctor next however he will just say oh let me do an injection. I don't want an injection I want to know what's wrong with my hip. He thought he was going to help my lower back pain by injecting three nerves on each side between my vertebrates on my lower back. Each injection sent excruciating pain to pain spot I have. I was in worst pain than when I went in and then it took like 7 days to be back to my normal pain. I'm at my wit's end with the pain and it doesn't help my anxiety when my anxiety is up my pain is worse when my pain is up my anxiety is worse it's a no win situation.  I am severely depressed most of the time. I can't do the stuff I used to be able to do number one is work I loved my job and I had to go on disability.",

Now 2024 the way I tell my pain management is I feel like somebody is stabbing me to death with an ice pick at the base of the skull and it runs down my arm in my fingers and up my head. What I just can't understand is why nothing works absolutely nothing is there anybody out there in the same situation where nothing works. I've had two spinal epidurals, spinal nerve block, two nerve blocks in the occipital muscle, botox, I have tried every pain medication every single one and more and nothing works two days ago I had to go to the ER yet again for pain they gave me two rounds of IV morphine did nothing! The last time they admitted me for pain they did the morphine, they did dilauded, and nothing worked! I just don't get it is there anybody that is in this situation I mean I can't leave my house for 3 years now from pain. If I hear one more time you have a choice you can sit in the house for all these years or you can get out to visit. Are you kidding me I can't even open my eyes my pain is so bad. I am sick of hearing you have a choice because I don't have a choice. It's just 24/7 7 days a week 365 days a year no thing is up and down pain when it was a two it was a two and then it became four eight now I describe it to the doctors as 10:10 Plus don't know if there is such a thing. I just sit up all night until I finally can knock out around 6:00 a.m. anybody in this kind of situation",

This man was amazing. He listened. He had to examine me and I am still in terrible pain from an infract of the omentum. He looked at me and said, \"did they tell you what caused it.\" I told him they said it was the weight loss. He shook his head and said, \"I don't like that!\" He thinks that I have a rare condition on top of a rare condition. I am apparently a fucking unicorn. He looked at me, asked if I minded if he ran a bunch of tests and told me he wants to figure this out and give me some answers. That is the second doctor to not like the ER explanation. I am seeing my surgeon in a few hours. I get to explain the pain is terrible and I haven't slept. I am not looking forward to it.",

Some antidepressants can also be indicated solely for pain also.I.e. snri working on the monoamin system does also directly modulate pain (not as much though, obviously)Also opioids come in a wide variety but morphine and codein didn't seem to work that much?

    "content": "My mom had surgery this past Monday, and when her surgeon came to talk to her pre-op, she was very nice and had an excellent bedside manner. All the nurses kept telling us that she was not only super nice but an excellent surgeon. I asked her how my mom\u2019s pain would be handled post-op. She immediately stood up from her chair and snapped at me that \u201cshe couldn\u2019t answer that yet\u201d. I was very taken about by her abrupt turn about. She then told me very condescendingly that \u201c50% of her patients are able to go home and do just fine with Tylenol and Ibuprofen\u201d. I didn\u2019t want to piss her off any more, but had to ask her what did the other 50% do. She repeated that she would decide, told my mom she\u2019d see her in OR soon, and left. When surgery was over and she came out to talk with me I again asked about pain control. She told me the whole \u201c50% of my patients\u201d BS again. This time I pushed back. Told her I was there as my mother\u2019s advocate and would not put her in a position where OTC meds weren\u2019t helping. I asked her what we were supposed to do if a situation presented itself at 1am where the OTC meds weren\u2019t helping? She stared at me, sighed, and agreed to send over an Rx. I\u2019m telling you, the master plan of the government is to eventually have opioid prohibition.",

And let me add that my husband is dying of cancer that has wrapped itself around vital organs and you are more concerned he doesn\u2019t get addicted than about controlling his pain. Something is very wrong here. So what if he gets hooked on pain pills; he\u2019s dying!\u201dThat finally shut her up and I got no further arguments about pain control.It\u2019s disgusting how paranoid doctors have become due to the government breathing down their necks about pain meds when they were shoving them down our throats a few years ago.",

My neurologist, very old man, short, balding snow white hair and a half Santa Claus  beard, glanced at my mri and saw the herniated disc's and all that. Said it was part of \"aging\". I looked at him and asked how many HE had. You know, since he's old asf. Didn't say that last part but thought it very loudly. \ud83d\ude02 he did apologize after I thanked him for being so dismissive of my pain. This treatment is wrecking havoc on our mental health as well. I have a friend who, you have to wait till she passes out from pain and call an ambulance because she has so much trauma, PTSD, from years of dealing with dismissive/gaslighting drs. We have to hope they get there before she regains conscious, otherwise she refuses to go to the ER. This treatment is so damn ridiculous.",

Yes, it\u2019s a very common laparoscopic procedure with a relatively short recovery time, but they are still cutting through abdominal muscle and literally removing an organ. As someone with spinal stenosis and DDD, it wasn\u2019t the worst pain I\u2019ve been in but I still definitely needed opiates the first few days. They won\u2019t give even 2-3 days worth of opiates to people who just had surgery to remove an organ. People are struggling through with just advil and Tylenol, neither of which are great for liver or stomach, in excessive pain for absolutely no good reason.

        "text": "yes you're right the master plan is to eventually have opioid prohibition and that is exactly why it is important for us in pain and dependent on opiates to fight back and be heard. I understand that some people have died from opiate overdose and I'm sympathetic to these families, but people have died from alcohol every day and its legal. people die from cigarettes and they're legal. people die driving automobiles and they're legal. So the answer to those people who face addiction is easy access to treatment for those who seek it NOT opiate prohibition. When you make opiates illegal or hard to obtain it does not erase addiction that exists and will always exist.. and it only empowers cartels and illegal drug sales.. so maybe that's it .. maybe some of the politicians are in bed with the cartels who would love opiate prohibition.. Or maybe some of the pharmaceutical companies and their investors in non opiate pain medications are trying to demonize opitates so they can push their garbage non working pain meds and make more money.. (because nothing compares to opiates for pain)I had a major surgery last year where I was cut open from the top of my abdomen to the bottom of my abdomen (and I'm a tiny woman so the nerve damage and scar tissue alone is unbearable) but I also had a bowel resection and biopsy of my uterus at the same time, and emergency hernia repair where they stitched my muscles together in the abdomen (they didn't use mesh because i get ascites) .. Anyway they had me on IV Dilaudid for the first 6 days in the hospital (half gram every 2 hours because 1 gram was too much and that would have been 1 gram every 4 hours but since I asked for half gram instead they let me have it every 2 hours) And luckily that protocol was effective for my pain.. but If i hadn't had a tube in my stomach for 6 days they wouldn't have given me iv drugs like that i'm sure.. because once they took the tube out on day 6 they switched me to 5 mg oxycodone every 4 hours.. Then they released me on the 10th day in the hospital and sent me with only 14 oxycodone 5 mgs, then the surgeons refilled that for me the next week, and by the 3rd and 4th weeks they were already giving me a hard time when asking for refills and started cutting it down to only 7 pills for a week.. Saying that it's already been nearly a month.. as if I should magically be pain free because it's been nearly a month.. It's been a year and I'm still not pain free from that surgery. One doctor even told me the nerve pain alone could last 15 months.. Anyway, thank god I have a good doctor who has me on 120  5 mg oxycodone a month and that has literally saved my life and given me my life back from over 25 years of chronic pain from before I even had the surgery.. Not to mention the giant tumor on my uterus and all that pain.. I wouldn't be able to be present for my children without these medicines. Opiates are a miracle for many of us and I hope that we can advocate for ourselves and be heard.. we need to be louder than the people who are trying to prohibit them.",

        "text": "(Rest of article\u2014 cause exclusive to subscription)The company said in a press release that it believes addressing variability among responses in placebo patients by better designing its clinical trials could allow suzetrigine to succeed in a future Phase 3 study.Researchers gave suzetrigine to 102 patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy (LSR), a condition in which compressed nerves in the spine lead to back and leg pain. The main goal of the study was reducing those patients\u2019 pain as measured by the numeric pain rating scale, which asks patients to rank pain from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the worst pain imaginable).Those patients saw their pain reduced by an average of 2.02 points. By that measure the study was a success. But Vertex also enrolled a group of 100 patients who received placebo. Those patients reported a 1.98-point pain reduction from baseline, which is statistically no different from the results in the patients who received the drug.Investors appeared disappointed by the results. In premarket trading, Vertex shares dropped almost 13%. Paul Matteis, an analyst at Stifel, called the results \u201ca pretty clear negative,\u201d noting that the drug and placebo both improved pain scores by about two points. He said that \u201coverall, we\u2019re confused\u201d by the decision to move the drug into a Phase 3 trial, which Vertex said it plans to launch pending conversations with regulators. The results of the Phase 3 would need to be positive and large enough to lead to the drug\u2019s approval. But that trial would be expected to compare the drug directly to placebo, not to patients\u2019 pain scores at the beginning of the study.Vertex said an after-the-fact analysis of its study results showed that the response to placebo was highly variable among different research sites. In the 40% of study sites that had lower placebo response, the suzetrigine pain reduction remained the same. The company said that \u201ctrial design innovation may better control the placebo response.\u201dAn inflated placebo response that can make effective treatments seem ineffective is a known issue that has dogged studies in depression, pain, and other indications that rely on patient surveys. One problem can be that patients and doctors rate pain worse in order to get into a study, and then return to rating their pain at a lower level when there has not been real improvement. Steps that ask for neutral ratings or follow patients before they start taking medicines can mitigate this effect, but there is no guarantee it will make a drug that did not distinguish itself from placebo appear effective.Analysts had largely expected that suzetrigine might not be statistically better than placebo. In an Oct. 7 note to investors, analysts at Leerink Partners led by David Risinger noted that trials of anticonvulsants had often failed to beat placebo. But the Leerink analysts wrote that they hoped the drug would at least be \u201cnumerically\u201d better than placebo \u2014 something that was barely true.\u201cSuzetrigine has again demonstrated its potential to fill an important unmet need in the treatment of pain,\u201d Carmen Bozic, Vertex\u2019s chief medical officer, said in a statement.In the lead-up to Thursday\u2019s announcement, market analysts had framed the trial results as a major moment for the company\u2019s stock, and for the millions of people who struggle with uncontrolled chronic pain. More than 4 million people a year deal with lumbosacral radiculopathy, also known as sciatica. The condition is a form of chronic pain triggered when nerve roots in the spine become compressed or irritated. That can lead to pain down the lower back and through the legs that in severe cases makes it nearly impossible to move. Current remedies, including ibuprofen, opioids, physical therapy, and rest, often come up short.RELATEDVertex\u2019s drug is a small molecule that targets NaV1.8, a protein that sits on the surface of neurons and regulates the flow of sodium ions into these cells, which in turn controls the electrical signals neurons send. So-called sodium channels are expressed throughout the nervous system, but NaV1.8 is one of a few channels expressed in pain-sensing neurons and virtually nowhere else. That has made the protein a prized target for drug developers looking to quell pain without side effects such as addiction or slowed breathing and heart rate. But precisely targeting sodium channels has been easier said than done. Biogen, Roche, Amgen, and Pfizer have all launched and scrapped programs in the space. Vertex\u2019s own executives have called the pain field a graveyard for drug development, and on three occasions the company took promising NaV1.8 inhibitors into clinical trials before abandoning them. The biotech is convinced, however, that it can succeed where others have failed. Vertex\u00a0announced\u00a0in January that suzetrigine, formerly known as VX-548, safely reduced pain in a pair of late-stage trials of patients who\u2019d gotten a tummy tuck or bunion surgery. While expertsdescribed the findings\u00a0as modest, the biotech has filed for Food and Administration approval to use the drug to treat moderate to severe acute pain, for which 80 million people in the U.S. seek treatment each year. It\u2019s expecting an FDA decision by Jan. 30.Some market analysts have projected sales as high as $5 billion in acute pain, but there\u2019s a larger potential market for chronic pain. Sell-side research firm Wolfe Research has modeled peak annual revenue of $11 billion for peripheral neuropathic pain, a type of lingering pain involving nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. Last year, Vertex reported mid-stage\u00a0results\u00a0showing that suzetrigine reduced chronic nerve pain in patients with diabetes, and the biotech plans to confirm those findings in a late-stage study. After years of industry stumbles, biotech companies are increasingly looking to develop their own non-addictive pain therapies to compete with Vertex.\u00a0AxonisTherapeutics and\u00a0Latigo\u00a0Biotherapeutics both announced financing mega-rounds this year to fund such efforts. And SiteOne Therapeutics, a Bay Area biotech that has a partnership with Vertex, announced a $100 million Series C round on Wednesday to support development of inhibitors of NaV1.8 and NaV1.7, a closely related sodium channel.",

    "content": "So, I've been battling what I've thought/been told are muscular issues causing tightness, and pain in my traps, neck, and the back of my skull that creates some pretty brutal headaches.Been getting semi regular massages for years but nothing has really improved. This last therapist I saw said it was a nerve issue. Kinda made sense considering when I get massages, certain areas like my rotators produce extreme pain with barely any pressure.Now, grain of salt time, the massage therapist is also a chiropractor, \"natural medicine\" practitioner, and a few other woo woo bullshit practices, so maybe he's just a quack.Is anyone familiar with any nerve conditions that could be causing this?",

Chiropractors usually like to see you 3 times a week for life, followed by every 2 weeks. If youre not too attached to the chiropractor yet you might want to try an osteopath.

Later struggled to open a jar and used my arm as a brace along with the blue grippy tape.Then felt a skipping tendon and a pop in my shoulder while shaking out a towel followed by reduced motion and pain. ok, gotta slow down...So I bring it up at physical therapy this week as my arm shoulder and pec/back muscles were super constricted, arm won't straighten, hands go numb. We work on that, see if we can release some muscles that are rolling my shoulder forward.  All of a sudden my leg flops and my low back spasms, my shoulder pops and then feels a little more relaxed. hmm. PT time's up. it isn't perfect but a little better maybe. I agree to keep working on it, doing my exercises.Smarty pants here does an accidental juggling act on a step stool while grabbing an appliance stored above the kitchen cabinets that evening...Now two days later, I'm pretty sure I've at least partially torn my rotator cuff and the muscles are spasming on either side to stabilize my arm.I really don't want to go to the hospital, will end up with covid, norovirus, or some damn thing. I absolutely detest urgent care and ERs.  But can I wait 3 weeks for a normal doctor appointment? argh. I'll try to take it easy for the weekend I guess. it'll leave me overloaded and stressed entering into the work week. can I even take time off for this? the guilt and shame....why am I not dealing with it now? Is it really urgent if I'm not dying? omfg.....Rinse repeat and this is my life every month as my body falls further and further apart. Sigh...Fuck this timeline where my body betrays me so.  This is a viscous cycle.",

I feel so unheard and feel like I\u2019m bothering my doctor by going to them but I need to keep pushing, also no one around me really takes this seriously. I\u2019m 24 so they keep saying there\u2019s no way I have autoimmune or something like that which is more stressful because I have no clue what the hell is wrong with me! My main symptoms are joint pain, randomly, different areas. My worst is my back, it\u2019s like a burning pain and feels quite stiff - I\u2019ve had a mri on it which showed nothing just slight kyphosis. Had a chest xray it was all clear. I just don\u2019t feel right, can someone relate?Idk how to manage this, it\u2019s soooo tiring. I just want to feel normal again:(",

If I get it wrong I\u2019m fucked.Got to a stage, 30 with delayed gratification, doing medical degrees etc, setting up business, learning how to get ahead\u2026A bout of constipation, and a long sit getting stuck travelling has finished me off.Had 3 minor injuries and mistakes, and now I\u2019m impotent, numb and in fucking pain.

Because they didn\u2019t notice I had a hernia.Honestly I used to be so positive, as an osteopath helped 1000s of people in pain. Was on my way to being in the uk commonwealth team for wrestling. Was good at mma, Olympic weightlifting etc\u2026.

    "content": "PSA: get your uric acid levels checked.Gout is an under diagnosed condition. Both gout and other conditions can be confused for each other.High uric acid levels can cause uric acid crystals to slowly deposit in the joints over the months and years. But the deposits can also be in other areas of the body, NOT just joints. As there are 360 joints in the human body there are a lot of opportunities for these deposits to collect in various places for those who have high uric acid levels.20% of Americans have high uric acid.A gout flare is an excruciatingly painful condition when it is acute and it can become chronically painful when it is not treated. I know of several on ther/goutsubreddit forum that thought they just had random injuries but the underlying cause was found to be gout. Once you\u2019ve had one gout flare, recurrent flares become more probable and the condition can become chronic.The prognosis and treatment is very good. There are well tolerated uric acid lowering medications that when taken will slowly melt the uric acid crystals- this may take months or even years depending how long the condition has been untreated. One can get more flares as one starts the medicine but this is counter acted with anti-inflammatory medicine until the uric acid crystals are fully gone and don\u2019t cause any more flares.Here is a great thread about the condition:https://www.reddit.com/r/gout/s/4antVP9wVhI am just making this post to help some of you as I believe that nothing in this world is without a solution and I hope this helps some of you!",

Ovulation and menstruation made me feel like I was dying. By the time doctors treated my endo it was too late, the disease has done a lot of damage because it's progressive and not static. My digestive system is permanently fucked up and my pelvis is full of scar tissue that affects all organs in my abdomen. If I eat anything I'm in severe pain.

It's a trauma and it throws the entire holistic system out of whack.After I had my daughter I started having migraines that increased in frequency and duration until one year later they were chronic (over 20 a month, most last for several days but some last for weeks).More women than men have migraines. More women who have had children have migraines. Estrogen and hormone fluctuations are a migraine trigger. Insurance won't pay for the hormone testing.So for the last 8 years I've been on every migraine treatment there is with no relief. We recently moved across the country to try and get better healthcare. And the deductible starts again in a couple weeks. I hate our healthcare system.",

Today was one of those days.Without a fail in the world I somehow managed to hurt myself even more after having such a good day.I stood up off our mattress that's on the floor and apparently stood ontop of a blanket. The blanket slid which in turn caused me to fall and I fell HARD. Landed directly on my wrist, my hand was bent in a weird way when I fell so I didn't land on my palm, not that that probably would've even mattered tbh. I'm a heavy person too, like really heavy. My arm was underneath my body so ontop of falling full force on my wrist I also had 300+ pounds on top of it.So yeah. I hate good days. Somehow I always end up getting hurt during them and then have to deal with more pain ontop of my daily pain.I'm gonna wait it out and see if it still hurts tomorrow then decide if I need to make a trip to the ER for X-rays.Update: got the X-rays and surprisingly it's not fractured or broken. I just sprained it really badly. Even the nurse was surprised when I told her how badly the fall was and it was only a sprain.",

        "text": "This sounds like a messy situation. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s legal for your landlord to enter your space without your knowledge or permission outside an emergency situation, and that would make me feel unsafe. Have you spoken with him to ask if he was in your room? You definitely need to file a report, even if you cannot name the person you believe stole the medication.Because of the nature of pain not typically being life-threatening and most prescribers having us sign contracts that address these situations as being our responsibility, I would not count on them being able to send in a new prescription, but if you\u2019ve been in compliance up until this point, they might be willing to work with you since your medication was technically in a place where you thought it was secure. If you could really die without the medication, then they will know that and react accordingly, but for better or for worse, the reality is that for people with most chronic pain conditions, going without pain medication is unlikely to be life-threatening, despite how much it may feel like it is.There\u2019s no easy or guaranteed solution in this situation, but if I were you, I would file the report ASAP if you haven\u2019t already, then contact my doctor and share a copy of the report and ask them how I can ensure I\u2019m still able to receive treatment for XYZ pain conditions until my next refill. It\u2019s Sunday, so that hurts your case because there\u2019s no one in the office and you\u2019ll likely have to speak to someone who\u2019s on call and not your normal doctor. I\u2019m not sure the best way to handle that, because if you wait, it makes it seem less urgent, but if you call now, you\u2019re unlikely to reach someone helpful. A portal message sent today might be the best compromise if that\u2019s an option, and then a call to follow up during office hours tomorrow.In a message to them today, I might say:\u201cHi, I hope you are well. I am in a difficult situation and am hoping you will be able to help. Over the weekend, my pain medication was stolen from my locked room. I have reason to believe that my landlord, with whom I have an ongoing dispute over accommodations, entered my room without permission and stole my remaining medication. I have filed a police report, a copy of which is attached to this message.This medication is critical for managing my pain, and I am concerned about going without it until my next refill, which is due on [date]. Could you please advise me on how to proceed? I understand there are policies in place for these types of situations, but given I believed my medication was secure in my locked room and that this is the first time I\u2019ve requested an early refill, is there a chance you may be able to make an exception so that I don\u2019t have to go without treatment for [condition] during this time? I greatly appreciate any guidance or assistance you\u2019re able to provide. I do feel this situation is urgent, and I will follow up with a call during office hours tomorrow.Thank you so much for your understanding, [Name]\u201dGood luck!",

I\u2019m going to pick up the other one tomorrow either way and it\u2019ll somewhat stave off withdrawals but\u2026This weekend is gonnasuuuuuuuuuckotherwise.Best advice I can give (that I can\u2019t do because my doctor is swamped and I don\u2019t want to come off as some addict screaming \"I NEEED MY DRUGS!\u201d) if you\u2019re in the same boat - If there\u2019s a small Mom and Pop pharmacy near you, call and ask them if they have your meds in stock and see if you can get the Rx transferred there if they do. In my experience, they\u2019re more likely to speak to you and, unlike chain pharmacies will do partial fills without a second prescriptionHope everyone else is going to be pain free for the holidays!",

    "content": "Hey guys im male 23yrs old, and I've been out of work for 7 months now because I was let go from my old job for not being well enough to perform all the physical parts of the job. I'm still seeing specialists to figure out what I got, and we've ruled out normal stuff and any rheumatological reasons but don't have a clue other than sending me to a chronic pain specialist (im still waiting to see them). Doctors said they don't believe it's lupus (which runs in my family) but that's all I've gotten. X rays are clean.my symptoms are: Muscle weakness/soreness Fatigue Joint pain Brain fog Occasional dizziness Occasional shortness of breath Tenderness and pain around ribs(no visible bruising) Strong flushing (has happened only a couple times) Headaches/migraines High sedimentation rate of blood samples Elevated liver enzymes (i rarely drink alcohol)First hospital visit had very very low potassium levels and normal magnesium.I've tried yoga, stretches, diet change, crochet, and the doctor prescribed me muscle relaxers, anti-anxietals as well as suggesting adding vitamin d supplements to my existing multivitamin intake. I'm still trying to figure things out, and it takes months to be seen by any specialists where I live. I've started using small amounts of thc to help deal with pain and my doctors are aware of that and gave me the ok to do so. Do you guys have any tips or methods you guys use to manage pain?",

The mri was the thing that solved the mystery. But just so you know if you do and they say you are fine don't stop fighting. You are not a burden and your pain is real, also I recommend a therapist just so you can talk it out. I honestly needed a therapist when I was suffering the most.",

You can ask your parents for maybe NyQuil or a similar one that has Tylenol in it. Maybe I\u2019ll help you get to sleep. I have ankylosing spondylitis, and then it started in my teens. So I do know what it feels like, and it\u2019s good to know that your parents Are on your side. Another good thing to help you sleep, again get your parents permission, and don\u2019t overdo it. Would be the standard dosage of Benadryl. But it doesn\u2019t work on everyone like that. It makes my sister psychotic, she says she wants to kill someone when she\u2019s on it. The last thing I leave you with is this, in my experience over the decades, I have found others may not share this opinion, but university Hospital systems are normally good at trying to get to the bottom of the pain. At least the one where I\u2019m at, it\u2019s not just hey here\u2019s a painkiller, they actually want to know what\u2019s causing the pain.",

For so many years I soldiered on and said things in response to \"how are you?\", whether it's \"fine\" \"surviving\" \"been better, but been worse, too\" etc.There was a meeting at my former place of work about mental health and supporting each other, we had a fairly decent group working there (with a few exceptions, of course).  I turned up to meet one of the guys on site & they asked how I am...  So I told them that my pains are getting worse and that my Mum had been diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer, so I'm not doing too great, really?!His response was \"Christ, wish I hadn't asked now!\"I have full body pains, different body parts on different days apart from a couple of conditions that are pretty much full on.I don't think I would want a day without my disabilities or pains, because it would break me having to go through all the brain training that I did to control and ignore certain pain.  And not only that, I cannot remember the last time I was in a pain free state.  So to me it would be a curse, because to feel the relief of being pain free, only to get it all back in one great lump.Saying that... One of the things I miss the most, is walking on the beach, holding hands with my wife. So, in that regard, I would do it, because I miss that so much. \ud83d\udda4",

Life expectancy in the US rose from 68 years in 1950 to 79 years in 2019, with some drops thereafter attributed to the Covid pandemic.  Significant reductions in child mortality rates have played a crucial role in increasing overall life expectancy. Improvements in sanitation, vaccination programs, and healthcare access have been pivotal.In the present US political environment, vaccination is under challenge by anti-Vaxxer nut jobs and childhood measles and whooping cough are again on the rise.  Reduction of US State and Local spending by the new Administration could substantially reduce efforts to refurbish waste processing facilities and replace lead piping in major urban centers -- both of which are necessary to maintain even the public health services and life expectancy that we have.  Climate change will also increase death rates associated with weather catastrophes and pollution of world water supplies.   Rising levels of homelessness and refugee populations also significantly impact life expectancy in the United States.Was this posting placed as satire or a joke? If so, perhaps I have missed the intended joke.",

It was an emergency situation so whoever was on call operated. Fast forward it's been 15 years. He's retired. No one will see me. Even the doctors at the same practice will not take my case.My GP has sent referrals to every ortho within 50 miles. They review my chart and say I'm sorry we can't help you. Thing is I know that. Duh it's been 15 years I know there's no help at this point. No more operations no more therapy no more injections etc. My surgery was labeled as failed. Ive been hunch back for 15 years now. My failed back surgeries have led to TKR HP and now neck injections. I just want to see someone for documentation. Anything I can do? Can I get my insurance involved? Thanks",

        "text": "A lot is going to depend on your insurer. It sounds like your GP is in your corner, so thats a good thing. Orthopedic doctors like to build shit. I see them all as having the biggest collections of tinker toys and leggos as kids. They built a cage, ran some rods through it, and screwed it all together to fix your back. Structurally it might be brilliant. But pain is more about the nerves than structure...So how about a neurosurgical consult? Id be pretty sure one was in the OR just in case, while the orthopedic surgeon built and installed their contraptions. Pain really is all about the nerves, you cant have pain without them. Theres just 7 trillion in the human body to pick from. But neurosurgeons sometimes see a situation differently from an orthopedic surgeon, so they might have some options that an orthopedic surgeon couldnt offer.I dont know if this is worth mention or not, but if you are thinking about some of the big hospitals, Mayo, Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins and such, are not usually worth the travel hassle. You can get ripped of at home, cheaper. But doctors are individuals and thats how you have to take them. Dont be bedazzled by promises of magic cures. Youre better off finding somebody close to home, is my point.How about pain management? You doin okay? I know you'd rather have things fixed a little better physically, but theres no reason for suffering. It doesnt build character, it just hurts...hang in there.",

I had to walk back to the butcher then wait for my order so when I got to the register my knee was done. I reached in the cart to load my groceries and fell in the check out line. It was more embarrassing than painful. When I got home I couldn't walk and literally wanted to die. I feel like shit and don't see a way up? I hate people seeing me at my worst on public irrational as that may be.its been hours and I'm sort of mobile but mentally, emotionally beat.

If I wasn\u2019t working I\u2019d still have the same flare ups anyway, I\u2019ve adjusted. If it\u2019s really bad she will let me go home early either clocking off or to wfh and be more comfy, or I can call in in the morning and say I need to wfh and that\u2019s okay too, and I can make up hours on different days too!I think definitely getting a job that you find enjoyable and is something you\u2019re good at (so you don\u2019t have too much stress, and you can prove your capability for when your pain causes issues at work) and that\u2019s either fully remote or a hybrid model, ideally with a small team, and a boss that is understanding, flexible and accommodating - without these aspects, I\u2019d probably be unemployed right now \ud83e\udd72I\u2019m not too sure on the insurance side of things though - I\u2019m Aussie so we don\u2019t get insurance with work and have free/affordable healthcare so it\u2019s never been a concern. I truly feel for you having that concern when you have chronic pain though, I can only begin to imagine how stressful and hard that is.Wishing you the best of luck\u2665\ufe0f",

        "text": "Yes and no. You can.... but it is a long shot. It requires anextremelypatient and understanding partner who enjoys just sitting around with you. Also, you have to be understanding that sitting around all day, everyday, gets old quick for people without disabling health issues and they are going to want to go out and do things. Personality and patience is key here.As a 37 year old guy, in order to go dating like a regular person, I'm expected to be making enough money to support myself and still have enough left over to do fun things with whomever I'm dating. Living on disability doesn't even come close to that level of income. Going out and having fun is a challenge and often impossible. So I learned to enjoy the company of others, even if we are just sitting on the floor doing stretches together. Doesn't cost us anything. If I end up hurting myself I don't have to worry about getting home like I would if we were to go to a place like an amusement park. Sometimes the dance with no pants happens. Sometimes it doesn't. So that just happens when it does and if the ability to do so is there. Muscle relaxers like baclofen can make it difficult.Also, it's a good idea to let them know that it's 100% ok to leave you behind to go out and have fun. You don't want to be envious of their abilities. Being able to set those negative feelings aside gives your partner a guilt-free pass to go live their life and have fun doing things they enjoy, even if you aren't there too. My last girlfriendlovesto go hiking. She goes all over the US to hike trails.  We both would love for me to go but we also both know that would mean stressing over if my legs will hold up or is she going to end having to drag my 6'1 220 lbs ass down a mountain.Many people can not handle this kind of relationship so the chances are rather slim. Not completely impossible. Just improbable. You need to have seriously awesome qualities outside the physical to have people even give you a chance when there areso manyother people looking for the same thing.",

        "text": "Ill just open this up with the statement: I don't blame EVERYTHING on pain, even though it has influenced everything. I was happily married for 8/10 years, with chronic pain for 9 of them until now, my pain was properly managed for 8 of those years. We were separated for a year prior to divorce (following along?) When my pain management failed my life failed, i no longer was capable of doing or enjoying anything due to pain. I could not fulfil my duties as a man, including financially and sexually, we became celibate for a year. I lost our home. I became frustrated with myself and my lack of ability. I lashed out towards my wonderful wife who was always very patient and loving. (There are other things at play, i dont regret the divorce)  ANYWAYS, all that to say if your pain is managed appropriately and you can maintain a reasonable quality of life, your pain shouldn't be a burden on anyone. Surely you may have to avoid quite a few things, but there are many more things you can experience and enjoy together. A reasonable person who cares for you will make accommodations for things you cannot. You are not required to spend every waking moment with the one you love, in fact I would say that is in opposition to a healthy relationship. I don't know your personal needs, but everyone is so diverse its extremely unlikely there isn't someone for you. There are many relationships where they literally begin with the SO acting as a lover and caregiver from the start, everyone has their own attitudes towards everything, no one can truly be boxed. Also I want you to know, generally speaking your place in the world sexually is extremely valuable, you are a clean slate without relationship based emotional baggage. That alone puts you leagues above almost everyone.",

        "text": "Hey There!I think its very hard to answer your question because its is dependant on alot of things but I can share my own experience. I have had chronic pain for the last 5 years and am currently in a relationship. One that is very healthy and supportive.I am with a person who is very much a homebody, like me. Someone who is capable of maintaining their own hobbies and activities and appreciates time alone or in paralel play (sitting in the same room doing different things). This works for both me as a person and regarding my chronic pain. I can sit on the couch or nap away the day and he is perfectly content doing his own thing. That on its own ofcourse isn't enough. Every relationship, regardless of pain and illness, takes effort.I read quite a few stories in which someone with chronic pain gets broken up with because of it. I'd say open communication (like any other relationship) is key here. A space where the partner of the ill person can express their needs without being jugded for them. Living together with a chronic ill person can be hard and we shouldn't refute that. So being open about it, both ways, works.One thing that is a natural part of having chronic pain is that it, for a time, becomes a bit of an identity. It disrupts your whole life and fucks with every part of you. Through therapy I have been able to let go of this \"Identity\" and found a balance between what is my pain and what is really me as a person. This is in my opinion important when you are, or want to be, in a relationship.Ofcourse its hard to find a good match when you are healthy, nevermind when you need to match with someone who is willing and able to care the way you need them to. That doesn't mean it is not possible. Many of us have loving partners and I am one of those lucky people.Don't undermine your own worth, your illness doesn't determine who you are <3",

She applauds me for everything I do, no matter how small, and makes me feel so good even when my inability to do things makes me feel worthless.We were married on 12/1 and I couldn't be happier.

He said he couldn't do anything regarding the note because I didn't sign a release (said angrily). And that he's been trying to help me but bc I haven't taken an anti-depressant (I did, he just forgot) I'm being difficult. And he feels like I'm abusing him by sending him the message for help. \"You put me in a bad place\" \"I can't just drop my case load\"I was stunned. Still am, hours later. He actually yelled at me for asking for help. I couldn't say much because I was in so much shock. I apologized to him multiple times.Suddenly, I understand why so many people are choosing to take their own life. Add in chronic pain and opiates and it gets even worse. I know why it is such a huge problem here now. This is the response when asking for help???I'm shocked and never setting a single foot near that clinic again. Even it means being without pain meds (soon) until I get into another doctor.I never ever thought this would be the response. Never ever ever",

She told my best friend that she was enabling me by going along with my \"game\" of \"pretending\" to be suicidal.I drove to the nearest hospital and checked myself in at the ER. They got me the referral I needed to go to inpatient. It was the best decision I've ever made for myself! My whole life turned around after that.I still suffer trauma from what that woman did to me, what she called me. I'm so sorry it happened to you too.",

Call his office and politely let them know that due to some communication differences, you'd like to find a new doctor. If he was prescribing you pain meds, check to make sure you are not in a pain contract. Ask the office if they can call in a one-month supply of your medication or a shorter bridge supply to allow you time to find a new doctor.",

        "text": "I had a similar thing happen with my former primary care doctor the day after my 3rd hospitalisation for hyponatremia when I saw him the day after I was discharged. He yelled and cursed at me accusing me of not taking my medications and \"making him look like a shitty doctor\" . He then threatened to drop me as a patient if I didn't get my A1C under 7 in the next 30 days as though he had no idea that the test is roughly a 90 day average of blood glucose.I told him to use his Express scripts or contact the pharmacy to see that I was filling and picking up my prescriptions and snapped back at me that he knew I picked them up but I wasn't taking them. I asked him why he thought I would pick up expensive prescriptions and simply not take them. Then he started yelling again about how I was making him look like a shitty doctor and if I didn't turn things around in 30 days he was going to drop me as a patient.My husband was thankfully with me and we were both in shock and I was feeling thoroughly demoralized. Two days later I received a registered letter from the shitty doctor dropping me as a patient claiming I was uncooperative, etc. I filed a complaint against him with the medical board that went nowhere because he simply lied and said that never happened and I was mentally unstable.After I found a new primary care physician I discovered how poorly managed my care was with him. I also learned that he was not a board certified family practitioner, pediatrician or gerontologist as he claimed. He went to medical school in a developing country and did only what was necessary to receive his MD without any special residency or fellowships. That's all legal but shady as hell. What an absolute douchebag.I have to ask myself how people like your doctor and my former one get away with treating people that way. I hope you find a much better primary care physician who is compassionate and kind. \u2764\ufe0f",

        "text": "Best advice I've gotten was to make the doctor note in your medical file that they refused your request, and in your case, make sure your letter is included in their report. Youll be surprised how quickly they change their tune and want to help you.Its normal to bring/consult a support person, you ARE his case load, and your requests aren't over and above what he should be doing for you as your doctor. Telling him you're struggling with your condition isnt putting him in a bad place, other than making him frustrated that he doesn't know how to help you - which is a problem for them personally and professionally, not a problem with you or your approach.We arent given a handbook for how to handle chronic pain or how to navigate the healthcare system, but they have taken years of school to learn how to be a doctor. They've taken 7+ years of training and are the one who is supposed to behave professionally and empathetically when their patients are struggling.For what it's worth, male doctors/surgeons have never, ever treated me like a human being in my life. I've generally had better care from women, but even then, the medical system is rigged against us. You should read 'Doing Harm' my Maya Dusenbery if you havent already.What state do you live in if you dont mind sharing? Is there a pain clinic in your area that you could be referred to?I saw your posts about nerve blocks and wanted to add that nerve root blocks worked great for my particular problem. It was a spine injury, so take this with a grain of salt, but they didn't work great for me at first and I almost gave up, but it took a few sessions for the nerve to heal enough that I could get off the gabapentin/lyrica. Your pain threshold is high and sometimes you dont notice improvement until a few injections in. Don't discontinue those treatments until youve had 3 or 4 injections if you can.Hope some of this is helpful.",

He is kind and caring but always forgets that I often can\u2019t do anything but exist.After anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, I finally resign myself to taking pain medication and maybe my other meds, too. Often, though, I just focus on the pain meds, telling myself I\u2019ll take the rest once I\u2019ve taken the edge off my pain.And that\u2019s all my pain meds do these days, take the edge off just enough to pull me back from the ledge.Before I went on LTD and eventually got SSDI, my days were similar to OP foryearsexcept that I didn\u2019t work from home until the last six months before I had to leave the workforce permanently. I know from experience, though, there is NOTHING more exhausting than wearing the brave mask of normalcy for work/school/family/life while dealing with crippling pain so severe it\u2019d send most people to urgent care.It\u2019s exhausting being us, no doubt. We all deserve a gold star and real medical treatment by curious, caring, skilled & knowledgeable doctors, pharmacists, therapists and insurance companies!!",

        "text": "Keep doing it. Because the result is me on SSI where you can't get any help. Why you can't get any meds. And now because I'm on Medicaid the one Medicaid facility in my area has been hacked so I can't even get a call to a doctor. If I'm lucky my meds will go through if I'm not I'm screwed. And since there's no computers working no phones working for the facility and all the doctors I'm screwed. So I can't even beg for help. So what you do is you write down whenever you take your meds. Figure what's happening is you're taking too many then when you go and you take the regular amount you're going through depression withdrawal. Not to mention the fact that you don't sleep. I'm on the high blood pressure medicine clonidine I was just put on it because I was almost dead 191 systolic daily it is knocking me out if I don't take it when I'm supposed to I get a headache I still have a headache now because I tried to push it 3 hours so I could stay awake. I have no freaking support I'm being audited still by SSI I can't find an attorney for that and I really need one I cannot make many calls because I'm so sedated from blood pressure medicine and that doesn't do anything for the pain it just makes me so sedated that my visions blurred I can't talk very well I'm so tired sorry that was actually a yawn with that. Also causes the pain to get worse in certain areas. No there's no other medicine I can take. And I can't get advice from my car they all just because naturally some jerk had to hack it and make it so that medical people couldn't even get in touch with the patients and the patients couldn't get in touch with the medical people. No hospitals no er's. And there's three in the local area. And so they did this not to PIH they did it to the clients. . Doesn't care if the clients can't get a hold of the doctors so why would somebody hack them and ask for a ransom. . Just never going to pay a ransom clients are suffering. Especially if you're disabled in a mobile you're vastly suffering. Yes this sucks you're right it sucks but it gets worse if you don't keep doing what you're doing. end up where I am??",

        "text": "There's still hope for you you're doing some kind of work even if it's remote. You have hope that's when you stop working or can't work that you have no hope no support isolation and ultimately just wait for death. But if you're working even a little bit in front of a screen in which there is money coming in we've grown to association that's success. I know you hate the idea that you got up you hate the idea that you didn't sleep all night you hate the idea that you've got to take another pill that probably doesn't work very well and if it worked well you'd sleep at night. Think you're at the level though that you can still do stuff behaviorally have an air bed. Unless you got spinal problems and airbed helps a lot. Riding down when you take the medicine helps so that there is actually that level in your body because if you end up on SSI they're going to not give you medicine and before they do that if you go to pain management doctor they're going to make you urinate into a cup and if you're taking too much they're going to get rid of you so write it down what you take the time you take it put a big clock a pair of paper that has a date on the clock write it down have a bunch of pens just right there every time you take it beside your bed if you have to write it down don't swallow it without writing it down 10 in one hand pill on the other I mean literally. Been where you are. I'm sorry it is so bad. Don't know what you're taking. But pain medicine never did that to me but I am enlightened now and the last week or so being on this clonidine for blood pressure but sincerely is dope me up more than any narcotic I have ever imagined except it doesn't relieve pain so I got to write everything down now too or I don't even know what I took. So I cuz miserate with you my friend and my phone won't write properly so I am so sorry. Why cuz clonidine makes your throat so dry that the phone can't hear you right and I have an accent. And I don't know how long I'll be stoned and clonidine and I've got court to go to. I can't find a free pro bowl lawyer for social security no can't find it for you all year none of them do what's called reevaluation or AUDIT for SSI. The places that did don't need more because they're financially broke and don't have the staff I've been told today three times. So my day really sucked too I'm sorry I got out of the bed also really regret it. Actually I have just a couch. I'm hungry but I didn't do any shopping and I don't even think I could get to the kitchen at this point. So I'm going to sign off with I understand how you feel but you're not at the end of the tunnel it can get a lot worse for those that don't want it to get worse trust me do some of the things I recommend stay employed right everything down. Timeless medications so they hit you mostly at night not during the day if you can. That's if you can bear the pain long enough. Unfortunately in my situation I have to take this every 12 hours pass out for 6 to 8 hours I'm a total zombie and it's just blood pressure medication and I have severe pain issues that doesn't even help the pain but not me into a zombie with pain. And there's absolutely no support. I might as well be talking to the wall. And it's dirty so I don't want to talk to it. Sorry that you're in the situation trust me get it scheduled if you have to put a clock everywhere that pallet paper right by your medicine you don't touch that medicine until you have the pen in one hand the pill on the other when it's written down you can take the medicine stick it in your mouth real fast. Not until it's written down. Keep track of the meds try to make them at night or towards the time of closing of business if you're working. Learn how long it takes the meds to affect you. It takes an hour before you start losing it. Take an hour before you have to check out of your work computer. Give a bottle of water near the pad. Oh as far as the dogs go time to get auto feed. Time to get all the water. And time to get a collar reacting doggie door. Make sure they don't get your meds. Those things help a lot. I hope this helps you in some way and a lot of us understand how you feel. So sorry. I am trying will take ideas if anybody has them.",

    "content": "Today my boyfriend of a year told me he doesn\u2019t think I should be taking my opioid pain medication any longer. I have had chronic pain for 18 years, have tried every single thing I could think of, that was recommended to me, have had multiple surgeries, and ended up with CRPS in my right hip/thigh. I also have widespread OA and PsA, and my biologic has recently been changed so not yet effective. I cannot take NSAIDs because of multiple duodenal ulcers, two ending in GI bleeds and hospitalization. I have had minimal luck with lyrica and gabapentin. So, opioids. I have been on them intermittently for 18 years, and consistently for about 8. At the same dose for 6, no escalating doses, no problems with scripts, etc. I get pretty good relief from them, and my quality of life is much better since I was put on this dose. I can now walk my dog, and go to my daughter\u2019s sports games. Things I couldn\u2019t do before, and things I am not about to give up because someone I have known for a year, who \u201cdid some reading\u201d, thinks he knows better than I do. Recommended thinking positive. wow, I hadn\u2019t thought of that!!! Wow, wish someone had told me that 18 years ago!  Needless to say, I chose my pain control and he is now my ex. I thought I had found someone who accepted me for me, but I guess that wasn\u2019t the case.",

I know it is the pill most of the time but it\u2019s one of the few times I truly feel happy and comfortable. I can feel the warmth in the base of my neck radiate out and for a few hours it honestly feels like things might not be so bad. I am just so run down, tired, and hurt. I just want to be able to live my life and feel like everyone else. I want to be able to do the things I love without being in constant pain just from motion. Pain might be a mental battle as well as physical but that is the one thing that really keeps the lights on for me and gives me the strength to keep pushing everyday.

The staunch naysayers- those that have fallen for all of the controversy & bad press, will not bring themselves to educate themselves any further about those of us for which this can be a lifesaver...(except to perhaps immerse themselves into all of the incomplete research which can reinforce their own negative position).For someone that knows you & actually cares about whether you suffer needlessly or not, there is a ton of accurate information out there to be found.Thinking positive is great & it is necessary & even vital for chronic pain patients to BE POSITIVE as much as possible, but it isn't going to help with real pain from actual chronic conditions & diseases that ravage the body with inflammation & pain. Whoever came up with THAT idea has never truly suffered.These medications can be relatively safe for certain legitimate medical conditions. They can truly save some of us from a lifetime of agony...when absolutely nothing else has helped.However, once some people fall for the propaganda, you will not change their mind. They have not had our experiences with pain. They are unable or unwilling to understand or \"get it.\" Once they have developed their opinion & climb up on that soap box to lecture, their mind is made up & set in stone. They have decided that the very thing, that quite often is our last resort for relief, after trying virtually everything else... is somehow evil. There are risks & benefits with all medications.Even as RESPONSIBLE patients who follow our doctor's instructions to the letter, there is still no convincing some people that they are WRONG. To them, the severity of our pain or how many times they have witnessed our struggles & limitations without help, just doesn't matter. They have decided it is somehow morally wrong to NEED relief from debilitating, disabling pain. To NEED to be able to participate in LIFE.A person that disregards your suffering & your needs... That isn't love...The ONLY thing that could ever make \"them\" change their minds, sadly would be if they became one of US. Accidents & illnesses can happen to anyone at any time in this life... So many people don't realize the fragility of the human body. It makes you wonder if they think that they could somehow bear such debilitating, constant pain without any help themselves? Truth is- they probably think it will never happen TO THEM.Live your life for yourself & your children. If you have found a good, compassionate doctor, be endlessly grateful for any blessed relief YOU CAN GET.Someone wonderful will come along with an open, non-judgemental & truly caring heart who will support you through your pain & struggles, rejoice in your comfort & LOVE YOU unconditionally.... I'm fairly sure that wasn't him.",

Both sides hurt, but my right is worse. At around 12 a specialist diagnosed me with hEDS, but later rescinded the diagnosis, though I don\u2019t remember exactly why. I am now 18 and still struggling. I have been tested for arthritis and that is negative. Every time I go to a doctor they run labs, tell me everything is normal, then send me home. I am at the point I am seriously considering getting a cane. Has anyone had a similar experience or have any advice? Thank you so much :)",

This is how the convo with the triage nurse went.Nurse: \"What is your pain level right now?\"Me: *Wearing sunglasses in the office and wrapped in a blanket* \"Its a 10\"Nurse: \"Well, that cant be true. if it was a 10 you'd be screaming in agony.\"Me: \"Screaming in agony wont make the pain go away, Im telling you its a 10\"Nurse: \"well, ok...\"I also think that because of our heightened level of pain as a baseline really screws with our idea of the pain scale. not sure I've ever described any pain as less than a 5..... and pain that most people would call a 10 is maybe a 7 in my book.",

        "text": "I think it's ultimately a communication and learning issue, because your current pain, might be considered 6 or 7 through observation of you by a third party. But pre chronic illness, you accurately would have been reacted to the pain like it was 10/10. It's just now you've learnt to tolerate it, so your outward expression of the pain is a 7, when it's really might be closer to a 10 for a normal person.This is compounded further with everyone experiencing pain differently because of their body and history/experience with pain. It is kind of logical to normal people that if you experience a 10/10 pain, that you should technically be screaming in agony. So medical professionals who haven't experience daily pain for a prolonged time, tend to not understand how pain tolerance over a long period presents. It creates a really awkward dynamic between patient and caregiver, because they might think you're a exaggerating pain based on their observation, but they simply can't understand your perspective, and throw a false judgement on you.The pain scale really isn't fit for chronic patients in this regard. They could separate it out for patients in long term pain vs those with an acute condition, or ask for two types of pain scores, or a score based on how much your pain has increased in 24hrs/1week etc, rather than how much your pain is out of 10. Even then, sometimes I worry my chronic pain is masking an acute injury, so it's a hard one to balance.",

        "text": "I have had severe chronic illness for almost twenty years now, lots of hospitalizations, surgeries, central lines and tubes and devices etc. (Just to be clear that I have experienced this, I'm not judging from afar).My pain management doctor explained his stance on this in a way that makes a lot of sense to me but seems controversial in the chronic illness community. This is how he explained how to work the pain scale for me and it's how I always rate my pain when I'm in the hospital, recovering from surgery, stuff like that, and it's served me pretty well so far.We are supposed to rate our pain byhow it affects us.So, for a normal person:Bee Sting: 2. Ouchy! But no big deal, I can continue with my day.Sprained Ankle: 6. BIG ouchy! Hurts a lot, I need medication, but I can grit my teeth and make it through my day with modifications (stay off ankle)Kidney Stone: 9. Horrific pain! I'm rolling around in bed sobbing! I need a doctor, I need an IV, I need this issue fixed right now, I cannot be at home!But for a chronic pain patient, our scale is different. Bee sting doesn't even register. Sprained ankle is no big deal, this is the level of pain I'm used to. A kidney stone might be a 9 for most people, but for me, it affects me like a 6 would affect other people - I'm not rolling around in bed sobbing and unable to function, I can grit my teeth and take oral pain meds and get through it, because I'm used to high levels of pain.But I should rate thiskidney stone painas a 6, not a 9. A 9 would still be whatever causes this loss of function and severe, catastrophic pain. So maybe for a regular person, or someone with a low threshold, a 9 for them is a kidney stone or a broken ankle. Maybe for me to get to a 9 it would take way more, I would have to have my broken femur sticking through my skin, etc. But the scale is for how the painaffects me.What do you guys think about this? It's how I always rate my pain. If I'm upright and able to have a calm conversation, my pain is always less than a 7, even if for another person, that level of pain would be a 9 or similarly debilitating.This viewpoint has worked pretty well for me. I never rate my pain above like a 6 or 7 as long as I'm still able to hold a conversation and focus, and I never have any issues with being flagged as a drug seeker or dramatic/attention seeker. One of the nurses at the office I go to told me that people who do rate their pain at a 9 or 10 constantly (without showing 9 or 10 levels of debilitation) tend to be taken less seriously which I thought was interesting, and a little weird.",

I said I wouldn't ever get one again but my new provider is requiring it because, \"you've had them but never by me. Maybe they didn't do it in the right spot.\" I've even had radial ablation in the same spot and that didn't help.I'm a woman in my early 30s and have had this pain for over 10 years. I just want a life with less pain. I'm not even asking for no pain, just less. Sorry for the rant I just needed to get something out there I guess. Maybe I'll come back in a few hours and say it was totally fine and I didn't need to worry.Edit post injection: it went really well! I explained how traumatic the last one was (and avoided crying!) They went super slow and did a little lido at every advancement. They were sort of laughing at me at the end because I was so anxious which I found a bit annoying but it wasn't untrue. I basically just said they would be too if the last one was so painful you passed out during it. I've never actually felt the numbing go where the pain was so I'm (extremely) cautiously optimistic that it actually might help. Thanks everyone!!",

This can be done.They can certainly test the location beforehand using lidocaine only and IF and only if the lidocaine that comes with all steroids never helped you with your shots before and the lidocaine helps now, perhaps that's an indication that his injection would help you.If the lidocaine helped before but the steroid did not, then that should be an indication that steroid won't help this time.It is your right to refuse any treatment that doesn't work for you.Are you up to speed on the negative side effects of steroids?

I was throwing up everything bc of the Suboxone (working to find the right dose), I couldn\u2019t hold anything down! For about half an hour I felt fine and decided to take 300mg gabapentin and 10mg baclofen. About 3 min later I became ill again and threw it up and stayed that way until this morning when I found myself sweating in my sheets way too much, shivering uncontrollably and sweating and dizzy on top of being nauseous. I was extremely anxious and couldn\u2019t catch a breath. I desperately needed something to calm down and I ran out of my CBD so I cut my 300 in half to be easy on my stomach and in about 5 minutes I felt soooooooooo relieved!!! Still very nauseous but not, like, freaking tf outIt was unbelievable!!!!!Never want that again!!!!It was about only 24 hours since I had had my last one",

    "content": "Backstory: I have central nervous system issues and they can\u2019t seem to find the cause. I also have chronic inflammations of tendons and ligaments in every joint. I have an unnamed autoimmune disease that Drs have given up on finding the answer. I have 2 neurostimulators for failed back and neck surgery. I take contramal/tramadol 150 retard 2x/day. And then some muscle relaxers. I\u2019ve been taking this for 17 years. Actually until 6 years ago I took even more.April 2nd I flipped my ankle just getting up from the sofa to get ready for a Drs appointment. I felt intense pain for a few minutes and put ice on it immediately. I made it to the Drs appointment. She looked at it and sent me to get an RX and ultrasound. I completely tore 1 ligament and tore another 1/2. I did rehab for 2 months and my mobility and balance was ok. The swelling and pain wasn\u2019t. The end of august I see a specialist, he was very kind, gave me an corticosteroid injection and told me to come back 3 weeks later. Swelling was better but not gone. Pain was still there. He told me to get an NMR and come back. (Our hospitals merged and it has been a shitshow ever since) I didn\u2019t get my NMR because my battery from my neurostimulator wasn\u2019t fully charged. First time hearing this. I told my pain management doctor and she laughed. I flipped my ankle again on dec 1. Anyway, so I just had a new NMR on dec 16th and saw my surgeon on the 18th. He asked me why it took so long. I told him the story about my battery from my neurostimulator and he goes off \u201cwell, if you have a NS, you absolutely can\u2019t have an NMR!\u201d I said I could and had probably had 20 since getting it. He goes off again \u201cso you must be really special to get a NS that can go under an NMR\u201d. I was shocked. Then he goes off that since I have a NS, I shouldn\u2019t be taking pain meds. I said I do because they can\u2019t get to the full region where my pain is. He goes off again! \u201cYou just like to take them because you get high from them. You should stop taking them. And your muscles relaxers because that\u2019s why you flip your ankle.\u201d I told him im not getting high on them. I\u2019ve been taking this dose for 17 years and if I\u2019m having a good day, I even forget to take then. And with his logic, shouldn\u2019t I have flipped my ankle many times before in those 17 years?!\u201d He had no reply. He prescribed 6 weeks of rehab, never mentioned my NMR and I left his office. I just was able to check the protocol of the NMR. Conclusion was: inflammation of complete ankle joint, 2 ruptures in important ligament and signs of lesser or lack of blood flow to a piece of bone where another ligament attaches. So that makes a complete infected joint, 1 completely torn ligament and 2 other ligaments with 1 or 2 tears and a piece of bone that lacks good bloodflow. But it was more important to call me a liar about my NS and to call me a junkie. He did check my other joints to see if I was overly flexible but no. He said my ankle has muscle issues, almost no strength and that I probably have an injured nerve but who cares. I think he thinks I came for extra pain meds and because he was pulling and twisting my ankle and i didn\u2019t say \u2018au\u2019 I was faking it. I\u2019m a pain patient! I don\u2019t cry when it\u2019s not a 8 at least! I had shockwave therapy and my therapist said the second time he didn\u2019t understand why i wasn\u2019t yelling and/or crying! He said it\u2019s the most painful place to get it done. He said most men can\u2019t handle a full session. It was painful but if you can\u2019t handle 10min of real pain, you haven\u2019t experienced a 10 before. His secretary told me she gets sick when she sees someone coming in for an elbow shockwave because she hears everyone scream. I thought it was funny because a friend that works in the hospital, was standing next to me when she said that. He asked if it really is that painful and she said it\u2019s one of the most painful non sedated procedures. Anyway. I\u2019m calling another surgeon on Monday and I tell him I\u2019m a pain patient and I don\u2019t \u2018au\u2019 for less than an 8.",

And also for a reason other than depression (The depression of course, is caused by decades of this pain). The ketamine infusions immediately stopped my suicidality, as well as my depression. I recommend checking into Ketamine. There is a protocol for ketamine being used for pain. It involves much higher doses. Perhaps get approved for depression purposes, and then maybe go on from there and use it for pain.",

        "text": "When you say NMR I\u2019m assuming you mean MRI?There are plenty of neurostimulation systems that are able to be scanned safely. That doctor needs to leave MR safety to the professionals who deal with it everyday since clearly he has no idea what he\u2019s talking about. Your neurosurgeon wasn\u2019t treating you special by giving you a scannable model, he was giving you a model that fits your healthcare needs and that was good and very normal.I\u2019m so sorry you dealt with this and I hope your new surgeon is much kinder. Make sure you talk about your mri results with the surgeon and your physical therapist. Also, the exam they do where they bend and twist your foot\u2014 please let them know when it does hurt even if it\u2019s a small amount of pain. You don\u2019t have to say ow or react (and any doctor worth their salt should know not to expect dramatic reactions when. Chronic pain is involved). Just a \u201cthat feels tender\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s uncomfortable\u201d is good!",

        "text": "I was yelled at and called a junkie by a pain management doctor. I went to see her because my pain management was making me come in once a month and I didn't want to go that often and my PCP recommended that I see her. I'd called before to make sure she dealt with adhesions because I'd talked to others who only worked with spinal issues or arthritis. The receptionist put me on hold to ask & came back to say yes, she did. This woman (the doctor) screamed at me because, she claimed, adhesions don't cause the kind of pain I was describing & I should have checked before I came in to see if she would even see me about adhesions! Then I was a liar on top of being an addict because who would call and ask that? That's when I knew why the woman in the waiting room was sobbing into her cell phone.I would bet half the people on this page have gone through the same thing and it's terrible that we're treated so badly, which I'm sure doesn't make you feel any better. I'm sorry they were so mean to you. I hope you do better with the next surgeon. I'm 20 years into this and the only people who were like that (so far) were that doctor and a nurse in the ER who decided I was there for pain meds because I was on pain meds. Telling her I already had plenty did nothing to convince her otherwise. I don't know what au is.",

I got an mri and it turned out that I fractured my cuboid and the X-ray didn\u2019t pick it up. I spent four months in pain, barely getting any pain meds, doing a corticosteroid shot in my foot, before they even cast it. I wore a cast for four weeks, and my cuboid took almost nine months to heal and it\u2019s still not healed right. I gave up on asking for anymore pain meds for it as the pain management where I live is a joke.Pain is relative for people especially those with chronic pain. I got a lower EMG done and the tech was weirded out because I was laughing during the shocks.

The year i finally had surgery i underwent 3 separate fractures in ankle and tibia due to ankle dislocations WHILE wearing a full laced ankle brace with stability plates.Never once did i wince or say ow other than each time i fell. Chronic pain forces us to endure what others term 10/10 unbearable pain as what i would guess is maybe a 3-4(basically heaven) on yours and my own daily pain level.Cannot tell you how many people I hear complaining about facet joint injections or other minor procedures which at this point affect me no more than a single tear on the injected side. No stress, no words. I cannot help but laugh everytime a Dr. or RN. says \"this may hurt a bit\". They truly do not comprehend what suffering is nor what TRUE GRIT it takes to endure with composure as what other choice do we have?Apologies I just wanted to write a smidge of empathetic support abd turned it into a grouse session. Please pursue another ankle surgeon opinion and try not to let that subhuman trogolodyte enter into your mind again.

I've been to numerous PTs, neurologists, orthopedics and whatnot and I cannot seem to get this issue fixed and it's been affecting my daily life where I cannot workout or do any sports.I have a disc bulge in my cervical spine, where there's nerve impingement caused by the C6-C7 disc bulge.My neck does not have curvature and is straight.My left shoulder is more forward, which is probably caused by tight pectoral muscles and weak back/trap muscles. My muscles on the back towards the left shoulder don't seem to activate at all when an EMG? is done (electricity is passed through a needle in that area and it should contract, but it doesn't). My left arm feels week, my ring finger feels numb at times and my forearm, triceps and traps on the left side feel tense all the time. It feels as if my hand is someone else's, if that even makes sense.I've been doing PT exercises at home such as neck chins, supermans, rotator cuff exercises with bandsm etc. but it just doesn't help. I've been seeing a PT since beginning of October 2-3x a week and there's barely any improvement and if there is, it fades away in 3-4-5 days. I've been to other PTs in 2020 and in 2022 and nothing helped there, but treatments were different there, too - mostly massages and electromagnet machines and heating laser.I really need some advise on what to do, because this is severely affecting my daily life. I've done MRIs on the neck area and I was told the disc bulges are mild and an operation is not necessary.",

Year after year after year.I just want to give the biggest hug to everyone who may be in pain tonight. Whether you\u2019re celebrating New Years alone, whether you\u2019re bed-ridden and can\u2019t partake in any festivities or whether you will somehow push yourself to go out for celebrations, only to end up with worse pains when you return back home.Just please remember that you are not alone in your pains tonight (and every night, especially in this subreddit) \ud83d\udc9cThis is just a reminder for all of us. You\u2019ve made it to another year of this HELL. You are incredibly strong to keep hanging on and continue fighting and living with these pains. You deserve to one day feel \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201chealthy\u201d once again and live a life without Chronic Pain. I\u2019d wish for nothing more than that, for all of us \ud83e\udd792025 is right around the corner.

I feel sort of high but not good at all just very nauseous and throw up-y. I have requested Zofran from my primary care doc and it has done wonders. However, it's still often a close call and it also makes me extra constipated!I gotta go to the next possible option, methadone. I gotta get off this Suboxone!

It is so obvious it's bs. I have had RSD/CRPS for almost 23 years. Traditionally, patients see results from either morphinevor methadone. I had tried the morphine at a much higher dose with no effect.The only issues I ever had was despite the pharmacy knowing me & that i would need to fill each month, they would give away my supply & I would have to wait.

        "text": "You should have a cardiac checkup first. Methadone does something to your heart's timing, where you if already have this cardiac condition, it could be very dangerous to take methadone. You want a doc to check you for something called Q_T Prolongation on the cardiogram. If you dont have it, cool. If you do you may just have avoided a heart attack. You will still be constipated. Methadone dosing can be kind of tricky, half of todays dose will still be working tomorrow with a 30 hour half life.. Many dosing strategies, 2twice a day, 3 times, it really doesnt matter, it lasts 30 hours.  And it is very financially friendly drug, pennies a pill without insurance.If you had a recent cardiogram done you should be okay, but it never hurts to be sure. If you want more info try \"methadone/opioids\" and Q_T Prolongation in a search engine, you should get plenty of resultslike this. Really got to be careful about patients with undiagnosed heart issues. Most opioids cause a little Q_T Prolongation but with methadone it can be fatal. Methadone is a great pain drug once they get the dose correct and used with a degree of caution, you should have no trouble, but building up the dose may take a while. Just tell you doc whats going on....Good luck",

You can DM me or you can get messaging me so we can compare Medicaid your Kaiser Medicaid or compare My health net community Medicaid to which SSI says now people don't have choices for any kind which is strange because last year I got a slip thing I like care Kaiser Blue shield or health net Medicaid I chose health net because that's where I'd been before and I thought they had my records for the last 25 years. But now I get this thing that you weren't allowed to choose last year something's off. And then DPSS says oh no you can't renew your medical here you have to do it SSI go to SSI they send you the DPSS called Medi-Cal or Medicaid directly and they say oh it's DPSS job. Yet they avidly deny it. Hope to talk to you soon that's my nap time because I haven't slept since yesterday at this time.",

There is an old saying \u201cThe only thing worse than a smoker is an ex-smoker.\u201dMost people with CP learn that almost nobody cares about them, or have a very short tolerance for accommodations, and try to pass as much as possible, and have less energy for activism than the person in recovery who goes as hard and fast and completely into that as they did drugs in the first place.",

I fought taking the pain meds in the beginning because I had an illusion in my mind that I would be high and dopey. I don't even drink alcohol or use cannabis because I just don't like the feeling of being drunk or high. Once my pain got to the point it was keeping me from living my life and playing with my young daughter I caved and took them. Never once feeling any kind of high or euphoria, just takes the sharpness off the pain. Now I even more wonder why people who are not in pain take pain meds.",

So it's not about getting completely off of them if you needed them for chronic conditions, but getting back down to your baseline level. That has not been a problem for me so far with my pain clinic that has managed my meds once I returned from the hospital/physical rehab. (I recently had a major fusion from T4-S1, no one is going home on over the counter meds after that kind of back surgery).",

        "text": "I watched a documentary recently about this and how Canada \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 has now made it legal to use MAID for mental conditions as well.   At first i was shocked but then i realized that as someone with both serious mental and physical conditions ,  I empathize.   Because most humans by default cannot compute the fact that mental agony can be just as bad, if not worse , than physical.    \"If you can't see it, it's not real\" is a dangerous lens to view through,  yet so many of us do it - including me sometimes.  It's very very difficult to understand someone's personal decision when it comes to mental health and MAID.     but imagine the person having to live this way,  and ultimately deciding that their time on this earth is much too painful, and to transistuon peacefully vs a violent method.    It has to be scary,  confusing,   sad,  peaceful,  all at once.   We live in different times.   And with that, comes different ways to transition.    As much as i would love to give OP a hug and say to hang on for another day,   I /we must also respect their wishes and realize that just bc we may not choose this option or understand it,  the person suffering does,  and has decided to go out with  a sense of peace and dignity.OP,  i just rambled on your page and didn't proof read this...   but i just want you to know that you are seen,  heard,  and loved.  I'm sorry this life has caused you to get to this point.   If we oniy could not feel despair,  loneliness,  hopelessness ... and instead  feel seen, heard  and loved.   For who we are.    Life is brutal and beautiful.   Whichever you end up choosing,   I want you to know some random person in Florida has seen you,  and somewhat understands your pain and loneliness.    Again,  wish i could give you a hug.   So please accept my virtual one.       God Speed,  Friend.",

In fact in the very recent past it has been quite hard for people to access given the conditions that needed to be met in order to be granted it. I am not sure if that has changed yet.Also I can\u2019t speak to your situation, but I\u2019m in BC with failed back surgery and I\u2019m on both long-acting narcotics and immediate-release, short acting (dilaudid). If you\u2019re not receiving narcotics for your pain, I\u2019m not sure why not. Have you tried finding a different doctor before going ahead with MAID? I know good doctors are hard to find these days, so I am not making light of your situation. Alternatively, is surgery not an option? Just trying to understand, MAID is a huge step.Personally I don\u2019t believe anyone wants to \u2018end it,\u2019 they just want an end to their pain and suffering. I\u2019m sorry you find yourself in this position, I hope you manage to get what you need though. \u2764\ufe0f",

Because you have seemingly healthy people who CAN NOT get a diagnosis or doctor and that\u2019s why they apply and die. That makes it very very sick.I was so bad in 2024 ( especially after a doctor messed up twice) I considered it several times. A simple surgery can actually save me I recently found out. But I can not get it. I was misdiagnosed for 4 years and other problems dominoed from it. Now I have like 5 problems all from that one problem. They have an industry to make money off you with one diagnosis while omitting any others. How could they do this? Kill people for corruption. I have lost most of  my ability to walk because my heel just hurts. My back, knees, hips, body hurts now. I have fluid retention, gained half my original body weight. Injections became a weekly thing at a point, and mind altering medications were a norm. And they misdiagnosed me for something you can just look at someone\u2019s foot and tell, visually with no imaging needed. Bunch of frauds Canadian doctors are. 4 podiatrists, 3 orthopedic surgeons, 2 physiatrists, pain clinic doctors, all frauds. Good thing I found someone from Europe to take a look. Said straight up to me \u201cthey simply don\u2019t have the knowledge\u201dWell what are we doing here?Wasted all these years waiting for more serious illnesses to develop. Now I truly have something unrelated that could destroy me forever and these years were stolen away.Please, hold on and look for justice. The treatment exists in many of the cases, you just can\u2019t get it! I\u2019m not dying anymore. I\u2019ll fight them to the bitter end",

        "text": "I've thought a lot about your post over the last few days & pondered what I would say with as much kindness and thoughtfulness as I could muster. Here's what I came up with:I'll be unpopular & post what everyone should have said to you: that this is not a good idea.My reasoning is 3 fold.Pain is tremendously destructive and I know at least somewhat hollowed out you feel; absolutely, with insane pain and no sleep after awhile you begin to no longer feel human. It's a terrifying place to be at. But pain isn't forever, I know it feels that way. I know in terms of how you look at your near future it will stay that way, but it won't be like this forever. There are alternatives out there, not many and not easy to see or find. But they do exist. You deserve to live and by killing yourself you are stopping all your future opportunities.I've experienced these dark feelings as I imagine most people on this sub have as well. If I had given in to these dark whispers I'd never have met my niece & nephew, never have been able to make my friends smile or be there to help others who are suffering more than I.  You are capable of so much tremendous good and joy, please don't do this to yourself.2. You are letting the bad guys win. The eugenicists that want us all to die off win by us giving in. The Mike Bloombergs of the world and the Andrew Kolodny's. They want us to die, they want us to disappear so they can make it seem like their idea of an opioid and disability free world is possible. We have a duty to live and stand up and go \"Fuck You!\" We are the evidence of the great murder that's been done to millions of good people and if we disappear gently into that dark night, no one will be left to give that reminder.The number one reason for use of MAID is chronic pain. We are being tricked into killing ourselves.Please don't do it.3. It encourages others to follow you. This post has 729 karma, with 168 comments and the majority are saying  \"bon voyage.\" That is immensely disturbing. Because we suffer so much, because we have been so mistreated it's so easy to go \"well if society doesn't want me then I'll go, what am I living for anyways\" and if we start to praise & support each other in that it could quickly become a social contagion.What do you think people who browse this sub but never post will think of all this? It's creating an expectation for what is considered normal behavior and this must not be the case.You are a great person who deserves so much better. Pls Don't let evil win.",

        "text": "Antidepressants work well for many people; not well for others. It all depends on what kind of pain you have and whether you're open to some potential trial and error. They take a few weeks on average to kick in and start working consistently. Unlike opioids, they don't tend to build up tolerance so needing higher doses or having he drug completely stop working is less of a concern.What many people don't realize about antidepressants is that they work by blocking pain signals, similar to opioids. Unfortunately, the name \"antidepressant\" sometimes scares people off by leading them to think that these drugs don't actually treat pain. Not only do they treat pain, but opioids also treat depression. Either type of drug can be used to treat either condition. Some common antidepressants used to treat pain include:Milnacipran - newer SNRI used for nerve pain and fibromyalgiaDuloxetine - common treatment for nerve pain and fibro; affordableNortriptylene - Tricyclic antidepressant used to treat painAmitriptylene - Another tricyclicVelafaxine - SNRI used for neuropathic painBupropion - NDRI used for neuropathic pain",

Chronic pain is one of the most depressing things, beyond what most can imagine,  so if its got an anti depressant effect as well, its not a bad idea. It depends on the drug and circumstances, theres a lot of different types of antidepressants.....I havent been sleeping for shit the last 2 nights, I think Im going to take a little amitriptyline, Ive got an old bottle of 75 mg tablets and break them in to 1/4's, its great for sleep. Most people in pain have real bad sleep. So even if it doesnt exactly help with your pain, an anti depressant can help with all the stuffaroundthe pain...",

    "content": "I'm writing this as I'm sitting in the car before my shift. The pain in my leg but more specifically my knee has been unbearable the last few days. I'm 21, I use a cane. I feel embarrassed using it at work. No coworkers have asked me about it. Thank goodness. Because the general manager at my last job was straight up abelist asking if I really needed my mobility aid. I'm lucky to even have this job. I sit and hand out tickets all day. When I'm feeling more able bodied (the pain fluctuates day to day) I'll do simple cleaning tasks. They're very accommodating.I use to have a friend my age that also has a cane. We don't talk anymore cause he basically didn't want to try to understand my dissociative identity disorder. That's already hard to deal with it. I have two partners and they try to help and sympathetic towards me but I'm sick of complaining because it's been a year and nothing has seemingly gotten better. I've gotten tests done and nothing's came back abnormal besides a few small cysts on my spine. The doctors have not even helpful so I had to go with an entirely different organization because Henry Ford keeps fucking me over. They rescheduled my neurologist appointment without asking me which was a day before my gender affirming surgery. They also gave me a hard time about wanting a second opinion.I could hardly walk up the steps today and yesterday. Usually I'm feeling decently in the morning but I feel like I'm gonna break down and cry every other hour because the pain comes back no matter what I do. Even if I lay down for 5 hours. It'll start becoming really bad again within a hour just from trying to cook. I find it so appalling that people think I'm faking this and my mental illness because I would not want to live with this or wish it on someone. I wasn't a very active person to begin with even before the chronic pain. But I just want to do normal things without wanting to tear my body apart. I have a neurologist appointment the beginning of March and I don't have high hopes because I'm not even sure what could be done. I would feel so much better if I just got a diagnosis and knew what was wrong with me.",

He goes to one almost every week and it bums me out so bad that the only reason I can\u2019t go with him is because he says they don\u2019t have any seating or safe places to be in if you\u2019re in a wheelchair. I\u2019m autistic so I\u2019ve always been shit at making friends. Id totally go out with them instead while he went out but sadly I\u2019ve just never been very social.

We WANT the pain to stop, or at least controlled enough so that we can participate in the things that DON'T make us feel that way..... most of us WANT to work,  we WANT to be able to do our own shopping, cleaning,  etc.  We WANT to spend time enjoying our place on the planet.  We want the pain to die..... and we want to be heard with compassion because yes, if we are left with nothing but pain why would we WANT to continue this way.  My heart goes out to all of us.

Sympathetic nerves fibers can sprout into the Dorsal Root Ganglion, release multiple mediators for pain like Cytokines and Histamine(which makes the pain feel like itch all the time.) I looked at as a \ud83c\udf33 sprouting roots trying to make a connection. As Nerve Growth Factor also plays a part in this, too.Another thing I learned recently, even searching and reading books in the library around America, was that prolonged injury and less activity in the neurons will lead  to a higher chance for sympathetic nerves sprouting. So, physical therapy IS important as well as activity. That's why Athletics don't have chronic pain from injuries even if they lose a limb. Although that's complex to explain rn on reddit. I myself never did physical therapy and just waited to heal and stopped playing due to the world getting locked down.",

You\u2019ll feel like you must be dying, you\u2019re not, it\u2019s your intestines cramping and squeezing and it will feel like a knife wielding demon is trying to make its way out. I thought my spine surgeon must\u2019ve cut something in my stomach after the 360 spinal fusion, because, I now have this giant scar on my stomach, because I chew tums for upset stomach , he said it must be a pre-existing condition and I should go to the ER, I asked his assistant, the lady who gave me the meds, :Could it be the medications that I\u2019m weaning off, is this a side effect? She said no. 3 ER visits later, two of whom insisted on giving me a concoction of pain killers, the pain went away they sent me home, third hospital I was not letting them give me pain meds, and the stabbing sensations were horrific, long story short, they took my gallbladder, they didn\u2019t need to but I had insurance and they tricked me into giving consent, it made them money and after the surgery they gave me more pain killers, hence the pain went away. F that hospital. Suck it up, when your weaning off, it will hurt, stay home, don\u2019t let them take parts of you, drink lots of fluids, gatoraides, pedilite, chicken broths, just a couple of days that will feel like an eternity.but it was so worth it. It took me years to feel normal again. Now I\u2019m back to Pain, kind of like before the surgeries, but, I have my wits. I just can\u2019t do anything and my back and legs and feet hurt 24/7. In January I have to have another spinal fusion and I\u2019m sure it will all repeat itself, but, I currently can\u2019t live the way I\u2019m living so, at least they are doing something. Instead of denying it for years. After three back injuries, in January, this will be my fourth spinal surgery since 2008. Hope it\u2019s worth it.",

Started the pain management stuff a little less than a year ago and I'm still looking for something to bring down the pain, I don't need it to be at 0 but I do need it to be at a level to where I can function and not like a 8 in the afternoon where I can't get out of bed. I also feel like getting an effective medication would make PT easier to do overall, in terms of tolerating the injuries that occur.

They don\u2019t inform me of this during the week at business hours when I could work on a solution. They only did inform me about my morphine not being available because of a shortage. The doctor\u2019s office then switched it to buprenophine which I found out needed a PA, on a Saturday, so no way to get those pain meds! When I called the insurance company to find out the steps to take to get a PA, the rep said she could help me, then proceeded to say she needed to speak to the doctors office. She didn\u2019t comprehend it was Saturday.  I swear, yesterday was made to try my patience. It was truly an exercise in futility.",

In fact, they ended up getting me double meds right after Christmas.From what I figured out, they sent in the refill request before I had called to request it (them just being proactive they are usually so awesome at this). They pharmacy didn't know that I had asked at my last appointment to up from 7.5 to 10, and the doctor approved just said to call when it was time for a refill and remind them.So I called on Dec 26th, talked to the nurse, and she said she would get it sent in asap.My dad went to pick up my meds on Friday the 27th, and when he brought them, I had a full bottle of 7.5s and a full bottle of 10s.Of course, since they left their control, the pharmacy can not take them back. So I just called my Dr office to inform them. I didn't want to run into problems when I don't need a refill for 60 days instead of 30.So it seems it's either feast or famine.",

They know we get our meds there so why not make sure they\u2019re there. I do know the supply is a problem everywhere. I\u2019m sick of the PA\u2019s also. Happens to me ever couple months. Another prob for me is my Dr. she won\u2019t let me have my pills until day 30 period. I\u2019ve been getting pills for years. She just approved me getting them on a Saturday if the 30 days land on a Sunday because my pharmacy is closed, otherwise I had to wait & hope they had my pills. It can be a cycle of hell.

        "text": "I would bet a fair sum that this problem is the pharmacist, not the pharmacy. Morphine is something that comes in so many different forms, its not likely even with the artificially DEA created opioid shortage. The DEA is quite aware of these shortages, since they created them, and their answer seems to be cutting production. That helps shortages. I wont get in to the whole mess, but in 2019 the DEA got the power to make production cuts at a whim instead of the end of year surprise normally associated with setting production limits.But morphine isnt a drug that should ever be out of stock. Hydrocodone is the same strength as morphine, I'd sure expect that to be in shortage status, but morphine? Not likely.Prior authorizations is a thorn in everyones side. Docs hate them. If you didnt need the freaking Rx the doc wouldnt have written it. Its in their formulary as covered by insurance, so whats to approve? Think about how much money an insurance company has at their disposal. A half hour's interest on such a sum would be  considerable.Thats why they create artificial delays in Rx approval. If the insurance makes it a big enough pain in the ass, lots of patients say \"screw the meds, theyre not worth the trouble\", exactly what the insurer hopes.To get a PA, you have to go through the doctors office. Thats right the same doc that wrote the Rx to begin with. The insurance probably has a (cheaper) preferred drug. So your doc has to explain why youre being put on an expensive drug like  buprenorphine, when Tylenol w/Codeine is pennies per pill....There's no way youre going to get your doc over the weekend? Even if you did, it would still take a couple days for the insurance side of the PA. If you could get a straight answer from the pharmacy, is the morphine Rx still valid? It would have been more time effective if you could get the Rx transferred to a pharmacy that has morphine.Youre allowed 1 (one) transfer between pharmacies on a controlled substance. Its a fairly new rule by DEA, so expect resistance. I was going to send you the link for the law but DEA's servers are down, atm. Those people cant get nothin right.So here an article about the law, its got a link in it to the actual law itself.It may be too late if they voided the morphine Rx, the PA for buprenorphine is a different deal....The majority of pharmacists are full of shit. Lurk in some of the pharmacy groups if you ever want a collection of people that doesnt like people, thats the place. Assholes. Now youre going to tell me you used to be a pharmacist, right? They really are not nice people. Using the word \"sadist\" is NOT out of line, but paranoia fits as well.Everybody is drug seeking according to them and most wouldnt understand a medical condition with a roadmap but they want to overrule your doctor...I would suspect the original trouble, of being out of morphine, is bullshit. They certainly didnt bother calling another store to see if they had your medication in stock. A pharmacist will tell another pharmacist if they have a drug in stock, but they sure as hell wont tell you. You might be a pharmacy bandit. So they could have been a huge help but instead, you got run around. Bringing us to the buprenorphine issue. Thats your insurance. They do it to every drug, Ive had it done to blood pressure meds, all generics. And your doctor and their staff hate it as much as you do. But its standard now. They want you to get fed up, and if you die early, without your Rx, I guess they wont be paying many more medical bills for you. There's people dying for health insurance, they wont run out.Hang in there. I hope when you finally get it, that the buprenorphine works for you. Its not your normal opioid analgesic. I suspect your doctor choosing a lower scheduled drug than morphine is more related to paperwork and regulations than any replacement for your morphine. Their office could call buprenorphine in. I also believe with a lower scheduled drug, you can go to paper Rx's, just in case the pharmacy is suddenly out of Buprenorphine too. I may be wrong RE that, or it may depend on your state laws.Depending on what drug it is (if its a brand drug like Belbuca) you should check their website, they can save big bucks on copays.Unfortunately theere's not much youre going to be able to do thats not going to take a few days to get your meds. The PA doesnt just have to generated by the doctors office, but then the insurance  needs to approve it. I think, by law, they have 72 hours to respond to the PA. The insurance company doctor, will need to evaluate your needs, and carefully review the similar drugs available, before they suggest Morphine Sulfate.....",

There are hundreds in development, with expedited 96-well arrays (calcium imaging, ELISAs, etc) and the recent increase in human tissue GWAS/transcriptomic/proteomic studies to identify a target in humans and backtranslate it into an animal model.However, the process of identifying a suitable target, making the drug orally bioavailable (because injections aren't sexy), and showing sufficient efficacy in preclinical and clinical trials takes 12-17 years, with the additional complication of demonstrating no extrapyramidal/psychological/motor/sympathetic symptoms  if it crosses the BBBalong withsignificantly 'improved' pain metrics in a mixed patient pool.Beyond that, your clinician either needs to: 1) had enough patients with different etiologies to understand which ones will likely respond to the new treatment, 2) listen to you when you make your case for trying the new therapeutic, and 3) justify its use over cheaper existing therapeutics to insurance, especially if you don't have an obvious physical pain source like cancer or a bulging disk.",

Im expecting a world of hurt though, and knowing its going to be days if not a week.. Im scared.  Expecially since its the only thing that has been working so far.Cause taking 10+ laxatives to go is nuts. I personally dont think its opioid induced constipation, if not a little. but for it to just be OIC I dont believe that. but it needs to be done cause else my GI will dismiss me again and say \"its just IBS and drop the narcs\". I've been waiting a call from my pain clinic.. fof 2 years now. (HSD/Heds is typically 5 years..)",

It's not magic but they help a ton. Especially Doxepin, cause it helps a lot with sleep.Don't rush it. I planned this journey for over 2 weeks with aiding medication and a plan of stuff to do every day so I don't just sit in front of the computer. Sport / movement helps a lot fighting pain, overthinking and so on.Good luck on your journey!",

        "text": "Opioids  put the twitching action or your GI tract (called peristalsis) to sleep. Bowel doesnt twitch, stool doesnt move unless acted on by more volume. Thats why sometimes you can get a bowel movement with stool softeners but its only the sheer volume of the stool above it that allows movement. Its not necessary to stop your morphine to see if the cause is opioids, which it likely is. They make lots of drugs that are very short acting mild relatives of narcan, the \"opioid antidote\" You feel like  a slight bit of withdrawal for 2 or 3 hours enough to get your bowels moving at least. Movantik, Relistor, theres a few others. Your pain doc probably has a locked room full of samples. BUt if those dont work, you gots other issues than typical OIC. And you dont have to be stripped of your pain control to find out. Or resolve it, if it is OIC..Its actually pretty easy,a doctor should know about these drugs just from Movantik TV commercials. You dont have to go through acute withdrawal, but if you dostock up on the toilet paper your bowels will work too well. Maybe some buttwipes too, after the 28th time, even the softest TP feels like steel wool....",

    "content": "37F caregiver(ish) here, probably important to note I\u2019m 6 mos out from finishing my nurse practitioner degree. My husband of a bit more than a year (together for 3.5 years) is not officially diagnosed a chronic pain patient but we\u2019re certainly headed in that direction. More context provided below, but I\u2019m curious what folks would say they truly want from their partners in terms of support with their chronic pain issues. I have read a lot about caregiving as a professional in the field and as someone who has cared for terminally ill family members more than once, so I don\u2019t feel I need advice on how to cope myself. I\u2019m looking for your honest thoughts on what has been or would be most helpful from your partner. Thanks for any thoughts \ud83e\ude77Context: husband is 44M, 6\u20193\u201d and 200lbs and has been around that for a decade or so. Has always had low back pain he attributed to his height, also has a long history of depression/anxiety, distant history of self harm. He is not medicated, had bad experiences with virtually every category of medication in his early 20s and now unfortunately will not try anything else. Recently had a year of mystery symptoms including a fair amount of pain that was finally diagnosed as decompensated arrested hydrocephalus and he had a relatively minor (as far as these things go) brain surgery to drain the fluid about 3 months ago. Surgery went great, a ton of symptoms resolved within days. Since then his back pain has gotten much worse. Impossible to say if this is an increase in pain or if he is simply able to recognize it now that the hydrocephalus symptoms aren\u2019t dominating everything. He just started PT, we\u2019re maxing out OTC NSAIDs/tylenol on a rotation schedule that I\u2019m managing to ensure appropriate dosing. He also uses lidocaine roll on (doesn\u2019t like the patches), ice, and heat. Has tried to increase activity lately per PT advice, but walks of more than a mile just increase pain at this point. His pain is increasing his depression and self-harm thoughts, but no SI yet. I\u2019m worried and researched intensive outpatient therapy programs since he is absolutely opposed to hospitalization or partial hospitalization for the self-harm thoughts. He\u2019s still hoping PT and once a week talk therapy will help.",

And he goes through burnout a lot because he also works full time since I can no longer work and is disabled. We can\u2019t afford someone to take care of me, so he does and I always feel bad, and like a burden :(Mental health struggles like anxiety, depression, and SI is common and to be expected when you\u2019re in pain 24/7 365 days. If you have mental Illnesses (I also have CPTSD w/ psychotic features), it makes the struggle harder.Honestly, therapy is a hit or miss when it comes to chronic pain because it doesn\u2019t take the pain away but for some people it can help with mental health struggles. PT doesn\u2019t always help and can make some chronic conditions worse. :( Saying all this based off of experience.Has he gone to pain management yet? Maybe they can give him more than just NSAIDs and Tylenol because they do nothing for chronic pain. Maybe and hopefully stuff like gabapentin, lyrica, baclofen, flexeril, etc. can help ease the pain off a bit for him? But, he needs to get through pain management.First and foremost, take care of yourself. But, you communicated that you have coping mechanisms already so that\u2019s good! As a partner, just do your best to be there for him through the ups and downs because chronic pain is well, chronic. There will be good low pain days and bad high pain days. And everyday is different. Maybe you guys can do stuff together that dont aggravate his pain a lot. Help distract him from the pain. Make a list of activities/coping skills he CAN still do to distract him while in pain and refer back to that list.  Or just hug/kiss/hold his hand while he\u2019s in pain, so he can feel something good besides the pain.For example, one thing I appreciate my husband doing for me is  he drives me to the forests and mountains once a month(I can no longer drive and used to be an outdoors person, but can\u2019t do much anymore because of pain). He knows I love being around trees. Like yeah, I\u2019m still in pain 24/7 but at least I\u2019m with some beautiful trees now instead of doctors and in bed. Lol.Sorry for the ramble. But, I think you\u2019re doing a good job so far. Keep it up \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\ude4f",

        "text": "For me, you are already doing a lot of what I would want. I want someone who accepts me and doesn\u2019t judge, and you sound like you are already doing that. The fact that you work in healthcare (I used to also) and can understand that aspect of his condition is a definite plus. I guess don\u2019t look at him as a patient and not your husband??? And as a practitioner, it is easy to think you know what is best (and you probably do!) but he needs to decide what is the right course of treatment for him. But being supportive, present, loving, and nonjudgemental. That is what I would want.However, he needs more meds imo. Tylenol and NSAIDs can be good, but he should try some other things. I didn\u2019t have good luck with gabapentin/lyrica, but he might. And an antidepressant like Cymbalta may do double duty for him. I am on opioids thankfully and they have changed my life. I know not everyone is as \u201clucky\u201d but you gotta do what you gotta do. As far as the self harm, been there too. It\u2019s hard when your life as you know it falls apart. He needs to talk to someone. I went to an intensive outpatient thing and personally hated it, but make sure he is in therapy. And if you can find him some sort of group to join, chronic pain or chronic illness, that helped me so much. Knowing you are not alone when you feel like no one in the world understands is priceless.Best of luck to you both!!",

        "text": "This may sound like a hot take, but bear with me a sec. I just gave this same advice to another poster asking a similar question.Getting what you want from your partner doesn't matter unless you're getting what you need from yourself. That's because no amount of understanding from you will be enough to help him get to where he wants to be mentally (it would lead to co-dependence if you tried, which usually doesn't make for a healthy relationship). It sounds like your husband has been through absolute hell. I imagine that's understandable taken a toll on him mentally. The fact that you already consider yourself his caregiver means that you're putting a lot of energy into the relationship that you don't expect to be reciprocated. This is not to suggest that your husband should try to operate outside of his limitations, but on your side of the marriage, acting as a caretaker can drain you after several years have gone by.The most impactful thing he can do is put his mental health first. Not only does that help him, but it also helps to set up a relationship for longevity by showing you that while he values and appreciates your emotional support, he's not 100% reliant on it. People get tired after a while if they feel like they're carrying too much of the other person's emotional load, we're all only human. If he's open to it, I'd strongly suggest him finding a therapist that he really clicks with. Doing so can help him to make sense of his diagnoses, strengthen his coping skills, define what he wants from the relationship, and formulate the best plan to communicate with you. I'll include a list oflow-cost and free therapy resourcesthat you can check out if you're interested.",

I have \"too much movement\" going on, and that's pulling the ligaments in my back. So we started doing some exercises, which should help strengthen my pelvic girdle muscles.I'm so happy that it'll hopefully be something I can fix.",

He sent me to an anesthesiology pain Dr. who said I\u2019m so sorry to have to tell you this but when nerves are cut they can reroute. Yours did just that & the RSD is now in your right side. Since then it\u2019s moved up my body. I\u2019ve had 20+ surgeries for 1 issue or another. I\u2019ve had so many shots from steroid injections to nerve blocks, & procedures & tests from top of my head to bottom of feet. I\u2019m told I need more surgery to which I\u2019ve refused. I\u2019m in pain all over my body. From the min my feet hit the floor in the morn the pain starts to escalate. There are some things I just cannot do anymore. I literally want to scream. I know what all of you are going through & my heart breaks for you. I\u2019ve thought of ending my life but in honesty don\u2019t think I could. I do however think on a daily basis that I do want to die. I don\u2019t want to be negative I really don\u2019t. I\u2019m here when anybody needs me even when inside my head im screaming in pain. I love my family & friends even though I rarely see them. I try to find positive things to say to myself yet my reality is, I just want to die & have this all over with.",

        "text": "I'm so sorry and I know just how you feel.  I had a botched hysterectomy a few years ago and pain has been a constant ever since. Lower back pain, bladder pain, pelvic floor pain, hip labral tear, and constant burning nerve pain from the waist down to my feet.  Dozens of tests and scans with no real answers and apathy from the doctors.  Now they're all telling me to get a hip replacement but I'm terrified that this awful pain I'm in could get even worse and I'm doubtful it will fix anything.I am also losing hope and wondering if I'm just going to remain this hollow shell.  I can't do anything without painful consequences, even just sitting at my desk to work takes a toll.  But some days I just say to hell with it, pop a bunch of pills so I can go out and do something adventurous and feel like the old me again for awhile.  I know I'll pay for it later, but I cling to those little moments of peace.  I always take lots of photos of my outings so that when I'm laying in bed and miserable I can look at them and feel a bit of happiness.",

        "text": "I hear you, I have a similar pain. Vasectomy in May 2024 and now damage to my genitofemoral nerve is causing debilitating pain in my scrotum multiple times a day. Medicine helps somewhat, but still going down the path of all my options for treatment, but I fear it won't heal and I'll need a prialt pump forever. I have four kids and my wife and I were looking forward to the post-vasectomy life, but at the moment that's not possible. My urologist didn't want to help, but I found a great pain specialist who's really trying to help.I have had a few periods of great depression, feeling another one coming. But the thing I keep telling myself: it's just pain. It could be so much worse. Usually pain is a warning from something worse underneath, but that's not the case here. It's just pain. Feeling pain doesn't mean I shouldn't be doing something or that I'm about to make something worse. It's just pain.Everyone that knows just cringes when I tell them what's wrong. It would be good to talk to people of similar pain.",

(Did not ask for them at all btw lol)Im usually using about 18 tablets  out of a box of 20 over the course of 3 weeks  but these last few bad weeks ive used 25My flare ups have been unbearable,  i actually used 3 of my tablets in just a few hours to find relief, my illness is very up and down i will go for periods of time where my flareups are more managable and then back to periods where the flareups are completely unmanagable, i often have to call my mum for help.My doctor mentioned she was a little worried about how much of my medication i have used and that we should wait till next week for a refill   which is no problem to me, but i was a little confused why she then prescribed me so much medication, Is she trying to test me to see if im a pill popper?  (theres a chance she thinks i only have 4 pills left due to slight language barrier and my mumbling)Should i be worried? i went for years enduring pain at home or visiting the ER when its unbearable. Now that i can treat myself at home in a way i feel like a criminal. \ud83d\ude1e",

        "text": "It can be helpful to keep a paper notebook pain-triggers-medications-subsequent pain levels diary.If you are detailed enough, this can help you figure out if your medication use is trending upwards over time, or if your triggers are causing more pain over time, or if your triggers have changed/increased (for example if reaching forward straight ahead now causes pain whereas it used to be you had to twist and reach forward to cause pain).Sometimes MDs will attribute increased pain medication use to \"tolerance\" building.  Sometimes this might be correct.  Other times it might be a physical cause.  Or it might be, with pain medication you did more, but the effects of that linger longer than the pain medication, so your nerves are more sensitized because they were physically irritated while you were using analgesia.  What I'm saying is, there can be multiple reasons and a detailed pain diary can help with this.So can a period of low activity and low triggers, and see if your pain levels and medication intake resets to where it was, or if it continues high.So can a period of toughing it out and building muscle, and see if *that* reduces pain medication intake.So can getting treatments and then seeing if long term the pain medication intake, and logged levels, decrease, or if the regions feeling pain decrease.Sometimes the mind and memory can play tricks.  And, due to how MDs talk amongst themselves, and due to articles that try to shift the root cause of unexplained pain onto patients' minds rather than onto something about the body that isn't yet understood by medicine, MDs can be primed to suspect carelessness, or \"belief\" rather than physical reality, in patients' pain, so a paper diary really helps make the pain \"concrete\" for MDs.  I think in part this is a matter of delivering the documentation in a concrete form.  I suspect that it translates to an understanding that \"oh this is real\".I am basing this partly on domain knowledge of how art & information & informational objects are received differently when they are delivered differently, because that's my field.I will also mention, I take a 1/4 cupful of nutritional supplements every day to prevent tolerance from building up.  I will also mention that tolerance can even build from NSAIDs.  It would help to know what your Rx is, but if you are curious about my list, I can share it.  You would have to check the list against your existing conditions to make sure you can take whatever you might want to try, of course.",

Same shit.\"Her heart rate and everything is fine. We only take emergencies.\"\"She cannot move. She cannot get up. She stops breathing. She needs to go! \"\"Nope.\"Chief Paramedic:\"Wait. Okay. Get up for us.\"Mom: \"I cant. I need help.\" As soon as they move her all shit goes down. Heart beat now under 30 minute. Serious shit. Turns out mom had a hemoglobin count of 2.2 is basically no blood. You should be dead or in a coma at best. Yes she was a talking awake zombie but damn. Oh, and a few liters of fluid trapped in her body cavity. That's why she couldn't breathe. Body was shutting down. Yeah. Doctor went off cursing, Saying next time make them. It's law they take her even if she's saying no- she was obviously not in a right mindful state,etc. They are NOT doctors to say if you are well enough. You feel it's a emergency to go, they must take you.",

Walking around cramps are 3-4 pain level after 5 yrs I\u2019ve learned to deal with it. When they jump up to 8-10 is when I start screaming and can\u2019t handle it. Well you last MRI didn\u2019t show anything else. Xrays don\u2019t show anything either. Ok doc it\u2019s been 6 months since the last MRI let\u2019s do one more. He finally hesitantly agrees but says I don\u2019t know what it will accomplish but ok. Do the mri and finally he see I have arthritis in the joints where the nerves run out to my legs in L3, L4, L5, S1. His first thing he says is I want to apologize to you as soon as I saw the MRI I saw it and realized your still have to be in tremendous pain because from what I see the joints are only open about a 1/3 of what they are supposed to be. I say why are you apologizing he said I really thought you were faking or it was just in your head! Can you believe that crap? I was pissed!",

Many are designed to make sure it will not help kuch if anything or anyone in the long run besides their profit  and the patient losing money.  A physical therapist should be in fact pushing people to the limits with in their capacity. They should not just be  allowing a patient to do the bare minimum whole they attend to one than one client.I have seen too many PT where I have to tell them they are not doing their job and get off their phone. Light stretching and riding a bike for ten minutes is not how PT should be. They are also supposed to teach you exercise to make you independent so that you don't need to pay weekly, sometimes twice three time weekly co pays. However, my experience is they want you coming back forever.Many of these PT places are tied directly to big hospitals and if you fail they recommend surgical consult. Which is insane because the PT program most likely failed to provide adequate service and then call the patient a failure.Most times if you 'fail' PT they recommend a surgical consult (maybe pain management as well) with the hopes of chopping you open for some surgery that may or may not work or may leave you wrecked for life. The hospitals and places affiliated (imaging centers / pain management) profit hugely by this.It's sad as many people think PT doesn't work and it very well may not for most people. The real problem is most people never have even been to real physical rehabilitation or therapy even if they went to a high end hospital affiliated physical therapist and did everything they were supposed to.Note: there is real physical therapy/rehabs out there and not all practices are shit. However, MANY are set up to take your money and keep you in the system by either extended useless PT or referring you to a clinic/hospital where both the PT and referral place profit.I also don't think the 'realest PT' is the answer for everyone. After all in order to work out I literally need drugs or it's not happening. I am lucky mushrooms provide enough pain releief to allow me to work out or I would not even be able to do anything close besides light stretching on most days.",

Most folks can relate to Legos.  Well, parents anyway.And I am often surprised at how much one source of pain can be masked by others. Again not that the bar for understanding is all that high.It would be a great super lower to have, being able to share what we feel...if we could control when. How would it impact everything if any time anyone got near you or touched you, they got hammered by whatever it is afflicts you? Physical and emotional?Its enough that I have to endure it all let alone hurt someone elseI have been to they don't understand what its like. \"No, you don't and count your blessing bc of that. \"The validation would be sweet though",

        "text": "My pain is a 6 today. Hows yours? That number wont tell anyone a  damn thing about your pain or mine.The smiley faces are okay, definitely more informative than a random number. But if there are communication issues it doesnt tell anyone WHY \"Mr. Yuk\" is a better choice over \"Pacman\".Descriptors help, but think about your poor doctor for a minute, every time they ask about your pain, they have to go through their notes to find your pain scale and look up how you feel. Its got as much value as the 1-10 scale, it just requires a \"key\" now.  Thats not going to make things clearer.The shading body diagram is great for location but with the pain scale, we are taking about severity.  Unless you use crayons and add a color key for intensity of pain, this choice is a bit of a misfit for a pain scale. Location is important too, dont get me wrong. But its a totally different issue from pain severity.I had a feeling you saved the best for last. Talking to your doc is the best way to quantify and qualify your pain. Also consider the effects of the pain when describing your condition, like you cant reach the Capn Crunch cereal on the top shelf. Give examples of how the pain interferes on a daily basis. Thats the best way to get things across, The doc has likely had occasions where they cant reach the Capn Crunch too. They may not experience the same degree of pain reaching for the cereal, but its an \"activity\" that most folks can relate to. You just have to make it clear how severe the pain is when you reach for the cereal. An \"8\" just doesnt get that done. Doctors use mild, moderate and severe. You may want to add \"call 911\" to that scale, but more than that is silly. You have seen the movie \"Spinal Tap\"? The scene with the amplifier thats so special, because it goes to 11, where all the other only go to 10. Funny bit, if you havent seen the movie, but its funny cause its silly. Just like telling a doctor your pain is an \"11\"....",

    "content": "It\u2019s been nearly 5 years and my pain has only gotten worse, I thought I was going mad. I had lost the weight, did the exercise, the physio and appeased the people I needed to by doing \u2018pain management\u2019. But I\u2019m still on a heavy concoction of pain relief that I need to be able to actually function and parent. I have a great Dr who is equally frustrated with how much push back her referrals get and we work together with weaning off the opioids and even though it\u2019s slow, she gets it. I knew something wasn\u2019t right and feel so angry orthopaedic didn\u2019t pick up on the fact that my screws have moved. I had to take it upon myself to go and get another X-ray and CT scan and ask my Dr to send them a side by side. It seems the screw is probably sitting on my sciatica nerves. It wasn\u2019t normal to be in more pain than 3 years ago, I\u2019m losing strength in my legs and the shake when I put pressure on them, I wake up in pain, I\u2019m creating a slipped disc in my back from the posture of how distributing my weight.I\u2019m only in my early 30s, I have a 3 year old with extra needs and is just so physical strong and demanding and I have no family support. It\u2019s so easy for orthopaedics to just dismiss and throw me to pain management and for them to gaslight me, telling me the pain is all in my head or when you\u2019re more stressed you feel it more. Well it\u2019s not, there is bits of metal moving in my body to where they shouldn\u2019t. Just really tired of falling through the crack and knowing I won\u2019t be heard. I absolutely know I\u2019m not an emergency case and I fall way to the bottom of the triage list but I would like some quality of life without constantly reaching for the pills.Thanks, Just needed a space to let that out.",

        "text": "Omg i feel you so much. My x-ray looks so similar. Double fracture of my sacrum. My pain started after i started to move more and more. It went away and came back with immunsuppressing drugs, three times. The last time, after a long walk it, it came back and never went away, no matter how much and long i was taking the corticosteroids. When they removed the metal, the pain got even worse.Doctors think its because the hematomas, which developed during surgery and after \"exercise\", are producing pressure on my nerves = nerve pain.Well, now the hematomas arent visible in the x-ray anymore. Still, the pain remains. Without any nerve damage during the first surgery.Im not even in a pain management regimen (in the process of getting there), but i feel your frustration.Im on 120mg Oxycodon and 300mg Pregabalin daily. Came down from 160mg oxy and 450mg lyrica...I was a very athletic person before my accident. Im 21 and now i struggle with pain daily, not even knowing the exact reason.And this is the top of my the physical burden i carry... Chronic gastritis, leaky gut, nerve pain in my arms, HIT and MCAS ... The next great achievement i got within the last months is ME/CFS and a totally fucked up immunesystem. Tbh rn the chronic pain i carry every day isnt even the worst. The undiscribale fatigue and the immune reactions which come with ME/CFS overweight my pain at the moment.Diagnosed with depression a month ago. Waiting for clinical treatment.A thousand illnesses + severe addictions + depression ... and this brilliant combination at the age of 21. \"It only gets worse\" is what my experience of life is right now.But. Maybe it might help you just a little bit. Always remember: it can always be worse.I know thats not a solution to your problems, neither to mine, we both have much to carry and much to go trough in order to arrive at a point of \"quality of life\", but its very important not to lose your positive attitude. Even at the worse fucking point of your life.I thought a year ago my life is bad, now its even worse. Despite all the pain and sorrow: enjoy what you have! Because: it can always be worse.Maybe you might want to read this poem:poem from keanue reeves \"ode to happiness\"",

I have had two surgeries, the first one put four screws in and a few years later (when it still hurt) he added three more. I've since had second opinions who want to take the screws out and seemed actually baffled at the first surgeon's choice. This has been going on since 2010 so honestly I've known more of my life now than I did without pain and that gets so depressing sometimes. I'm a nurse so I am on my feet for 12hr shifts sometimes with minimal breaks. I basically just have to function on autopilot, disassociate from the pain. It's terrible and has brought my quality of life down to almost nothing on the really bad days. I have an appointment with a pain management after years of accepting this as my reality on the 30th so, wish me luck.",

However, I know they\u2019re not recommended to get more than a couple times as they can cause muscle breakdown and some other issues I\u2019m not as familiar with. I\u2019d say it\u2019s safe to try it once if your doctor says it\u2019s ok but if the pain comes back I probably wouldn\u2019t do it again. Also if your pain isn\u2019t caused by inflammation there\u2019s really no point. Another thing is for me personally the injection was really painful although it went away within half an hour. This may have been because it was injected into my wrist though, not sure about other parts of the body.",

I refuse to let these criminals and their illegal 'laws' dictate how *I* fucking live. I'm a freeborn American and the Constitution is MY 'Law', and there ain't shit in IT about what I can eat drink, smoke, etc etc and I'm just not having it. If this is the fucking Hoop I have to jump thru, than Fine, lets get to fucking jumpin. If anyone is interested in joinin up for strength in Numbers, Im open to that too. (NOT a lame 'hook up ploy', lets make THAT Crystal CLEAR, Lol ) But otherwise I have no issue with grouping together and help each other save some money, etc. But going alone is NO Issue, either. I'm a combat Vet, 60 yo, and not exactly introverted, lol. But I'm only an asshole if I'm left with no other options, generally speaking. I just want to live out my years in reasonable 'comfort', and be able to do the things that interest me, until my last breath. Right now, thats not happening as it should be, and I'm over it.I've heard Colombia, Argentina, etc, and Mexico,and Costa Rica/Dominican Repub.  Also  Europe, places like Czech Repub., and Portugal, Switzerland, and Netherlands, of course.Anyone have ANY recent idea if any of these are legit, and if so, who or where to go to find out more info.  I'm an experienced traveler and a Vet, so I'm not stupid, or childish, and I certainly don't look or act 'sketchy' or like a tweaker or anything weird, so I'm not worried about any of that side of it- ALL comments welcome, let me hear from you.CLEARLY, NO ONE IS COMING TO SAVE US. So it IS what it IS.  And thats FINE W Me. I only need these assholes to get the fuck out of my GD way, and I would be fine, now, FFS.  Smfh. I think I'm MOST pissed at these asshole setting them selves up as the High & Mighty Gatekeepers, and now we find out MOST couldn't keep their hands off all that SWEEEET PHARMA CASH and pushed all kinds of shit on all kinds of folks that shouldn't have ever been pushed on, and NOW they are all pissin themselves, praying they don't get 'found out' so NOW 'DRUUUGS ARRRE BAAAAD MMKAY KIDS !!'WELL, FUCK THEM. HARD. I'm*NOT* GONNA KEEP SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THEIR WEAK WILLS.Anyway, thats the plan until I find out anything that makes this not possible.",

        "text": "Colombia, Ecuador, Peru still have actual opioid pain meds available and some are available otc. Dominican Republic also from what I have read. Parts of northern India produce medical opium which would probably be the least toxic and most effective but might be a challenge to live there and procure. This is a pathetic and stupid problem, many of us will never feel normal without opioid pain meds. Opioids are one of the oldest and most effective substances mankind has utilized to improve our quality of life or to recover from injury. 5000 years of historical usage. People that do not have chronic pain don\u2019t seem to be-able to grasp a couple of key considerations. One is most chronic pain patients don\u2019t experience any euphoria when they take opioids, they feel normal, you can alter your levels of consumption depending on how bad your pain is you don\u2019t always need to take the maximum amount or keep increasing your dose.  Most chronic pain patients will reach a stable prescription dose and stay on roughly the same dose for years. In my case I don\u2019t need to take them everyday in the summer but as soon as the temp drops below freezing I have to have them daily to function normally. Many high functioning individuals would not have been able to preform in society if they were not on opioids. JFK was on huge levels of narcotics while dealing with some of the most difficult times in recent history. Just to name one. This is just another example of how unbridled greed has ruined a high functioning system. The same thing has happened to basically every aspect of our lives, housing, it\u2019s not just where you live instead it\u2019s been turned into a twisted greed factory where it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to rent out your closet for a couple hundred bucks any time and anywhere you feel like it because people are so desperate for shelter, vehicles prices are such that you never actually own your car you basically rent it for $1000 a month forever. Medical care is not about your health it\u2019s about money and greed. Food isn\u2019t about taste and nutrition, it\u2019s about money and profit. Don\u2019t be surprised to see a huge pro communism movement about the time trump leaves office if he does. There is no value in American life, it is all monetized, metered, buffered and gamed.",

Anytime you procure a narcotic medication without going through legitimate channels of having it prescribed by a doctor, you risk receiving something adulterated. But don't take my word for it, just google it. There are hundreds of news articles about this issue. If you plan to pursue this, you should go in with the expectation that you won't receive legitimate pharmaceuticals and everything you take can pose an OD risk due to illicit fentanyl. If you're on board with that, then have at it. Or, if you'd rather just have a doctor prescribe you the real thing,here's what to do.",

Several Hospitals, including the VA,where I go, NOW have it as written Policy. All the Facts in the World no longer make any difference, Hence my very serious questions about options Abroad.Not being snarky at all, but its just no longer relevant here, sad to say. When I complained to Patient Advocacy at the VA, while the guy I spoke to was very nice and sympathetic, its just a Done Deal. He even told me that they actually caused the Deaths of at least one Elderly FT Resident there,who was in his 90s, by stopping his narcotic meds cold turkey after 30 years. I think he volunteered that to me just to give me an idea of how hopeless it is to even bother, and I can't say he's wrong. If they are willing to do that, because of 'Policy', as opposed to a RATIONAL, 'Case by Case evaluation' - Then there truly is Zero Hope, OR Point in pursuing it further. I was floored he even told me that story, TBH. But I guess what am I gonna do ? Who's gonna believe me,and I don't even have the poor Vet's Name.THIS is the World we are dealing with.",

And so the pharmacy fills it on day 27-29 of 30- the pharmacy then calls and tells you your script is ready- (mind you-  it doesn't matter when it gets picked up)-  so you get blamed and accused of being an addict for \"filling a script early\" even if you never had a single day off \"extra medication\".... Even better, you're labeled high risk, so your doctor decides to drop you anyway.Oh, sorry if these are detailed. If you can tell, I'm not just coming up with generic examples.",

It feels like if not one part of my body is hurting then another part is. I\u2019m never without pain it feels like it\u2019s my default setting. In the thick of the pain last night I was thinking of how I must deserve this pain and do not deserve any relief from it. That somehow I did this to myself and so I must suffer the rest of my life.Does anyone else ever feel like that? I know logically I don\u2019t deserve the pain and I didn\u2019t bring it upon myself but my mind goes there every time and I hate it.",

I used to be jealous of people with endo diagnoses because apparently I was just cursed with super painful periods for no reason besides being weak. Then the pain became chronic, and after a lot of fighting I had surgery and it turned out I had endo all along lol. It kind of broke my brain. Nowadays I think that God hates me and is torturing me because of like bad karma or something. I feel like there's something ive done to deserve this even tho I know many people who are worse than me and live with perfect health and easy, happy lives.

Then I had horrible pain conditions start and my anxiety and depression got worse. I eventually tried alcohol and it made everything go away magically. Eventually the hangovers got to be worse than just suffering without the alcohol but evety once in a while I get to where I have to drink to have a moment of peace even knowing the cost the next day. I now realize how much most of my family was probably self medicating for physical and mental health issues that as a poor person nobody cares about. I've had multiple serious issues that were blatantly ignored by drs until I had to get emergency surgery. Even after the surgery they cut off care for me way quicker than anyone I know. They acted surprised I was exhausted going back to work after a bone tumor shattering my femur after only a month post op. But everyone else I talked to at the clinic got 3 months or more out of work for planned orthopedic surgery not involving tumors. They also don't believe I still have pain in that hip/leg. Like I cannot lay on my right side because it hurts so bad. And my back is now all jacked up so getting comfortable to sleep is damn near impossible. But I always feel like I'm maybe not in as much pain as I feel, that it is all in my head. That I'm just an alcoholic like my family even though I don't drink often. That I caused everything. It's completely insane when I really think about it. But it's hard not to at times.",

A lot of my pain is kind of \"my fault\" too because I have GERD and likely fibromyalgia (although I haven't been given an official fibro diagnosis) because only up until a few months ago I consistently ate better and exercised. And still that wasn't enough to prevent the digestive and muscular issues I have now. At the end of the day though, hating ourselves is not a way to live. It helps me to picture my body as the body of someone I love. Because if my loved ones needed physical therapy or medication or accommodations I would be more than happy to help them get their needs met, but when it's myself I tend to feel like who cares what happens to me.

I ask because the idea \"deserving to suffer\" is one that's normalized in a lot of religions. \"I must have done something terrible to deserve this\" might SEEM humble at first glance but it's a real toxic mindset because the moment you start attaching crime and punishment to pain, and use it as an arbiter of justice and reason, you start victim-blaming.Pain is not a morality factor. It's not a punishment for a wrongdoing. It's just a fact of life, how when a deer gets caught in a trap and limps, it does not \"deserve\" pain. A woman does not \"deserve\" pain from having a child, no matter how much patriarchal religious text likes to tell us to justify ignoring women's suffering. You don't \"deserve\" pain for being ill.

I\u2019ve finally been able to afford acupuncture and after years of doctors writing off my pain I went ahead and started treatment. It\u2019s only been two sessions but it\u2019s made a world of difference. Recently, I\u2019ve had such chronic anxiety where I don\u2019t\u2026 feel right in my body? I want to crawl out of my skin. My body doesn\u2019t feel like a safe space, if that makes sense. It\u2019s just.. unfamiliar. I hadn\u2019t been able to figure out why for a while. Then it kind of hit me just a moment ago. I haven\u2019t been in nearly as much pain. I guess I didn\u2019t notice it as much because I\u2019ve had the flu so I\u2019ve been so focused on coughing my lungs out.But I\u2019ve been in chronic pain since I was a kid. As long as I can remember I haven\u2019t gone a single day without pain. I used to wake my whole family up in the night because I\u2019d be screaming in pain in my asleep.Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m so greatful my pain has greatly diminish. It\u2019s not fully gone, but I don\u2019t spend nights awake sobbing begging for it to end. But it just feels so SO overwhelming now that I\u2019m not in as much pain. I\u2019m sobbing from having an anxiety attack of not feeling like this is my body anymore (not saying I miss my pain riddled body.)My husband has been comforting and supporting. He has his own health issues but not like this so he doesn\u2019t quite understand.So I don\u2019t expect anyone to read this but thanks to anyone who does I suppose?",

I\u2019m not supposed to see progress until late February or March and even was warned it could get briefly worse. I\u2019m using Nervive and some supplements (vitamin D and some natural stuff) and will be returning to physical therapy. I am going to listen to my body and not over exert but I went out this weekend for a birthday dinner. I\u2019m saying this because I thought pudendal neuralgia/pelvic CRPS had ruined my life at one point. Now as pelvic pain has reduced by the pudendal release my pain did travel into a migraine briefly as CRPS does but I\u2019m now going to realign and take care of my central nervous system now my neurologist is on it and is commited to making that area of my body my new focus. I am so happy to finally have hope for the new year.",

It took me the better part of that to figure it out. Most dsys are not happy or fun, but I try to work on being happy. Anger and crying are always close by.",

        "text": "I hear ya on the ANGER !!!. I\u2019m just pissed off all the time , I have no patience for anything . I\u2019ve tried to watch movies, read books , watch YouTube videos from time to time on a hobbies I use to love but no matter I seem to lose interest within just a few minutes.  My wife passed  a few yrs back from cancer.  I\u2019ve had several very short term relationships ( like couple weeks maybe) I really miss the closeness of being with someone. I\u2019ve considered just ending it all several times as the physical & mental pain combined at times is just too much , I just don\u2019t see any future in any of it . And then couple that with the B S we are forced to go thru trying to get treatment. I\u2019m just ANGRY and I can\u2019t control it , I\u2019ve tried and tried every once in awhile I sorta fake it for a day or two but it just comes back . I\u2019ve looked for triggers like trying to write down what set off and I just can\u2019t see a pattern . Every morning  I\u2019m awakened by the constant pain , and this happens several times during the nite as well it\u2019s turned into a never ending cycle and ask myself why is this even necessary like what purpose does it serve , why can\u2019t it just end . I use to have a life I had a purpose, I\u2019m just so tired mentally & physically I feel so drained . I don\u2019t want to spend another decade or year or month like this I\u2019m just so over it",

I don't feel high or loopy or anything fun like that, in fact I often forget I'm on them, but it gives me a brief \"wait, is thisreallyworth getting pissed at? ... No, arguing this isn't worth my fucking time...\" where before I would normally blow up.My mom wasveryagainst it because \"you're notpsychotic, you're justvery grouchy!\" But a few months into me being on them she admitted that she had told my aunt she wished I had been taking these since I was like 13, as it probably would have stopped a ton of stupid arguments",

        "text": "I\u2019m lucky that I found a doctor that openly admitted he didn\u2019t know enough about my condition but believed I had it after many tests to rule out other issues. He promised me that he would study it and get me an appointment ASAP. He actually bothered to ask me what worked in the past, and I explained why I didn\u2019t want to take certain things, like ibuprofen I can\u2019t take it often because I\u2019m asthmatic. And I can\u2019t take aspirin either. So we worked out what worked, and when it got worse we added another medication to cover the parts that weren\u2019t being handled with just pain killers. I\u2019m very thankful to him for bothering to do all that. Because about a year later I saw another GP, and she pop quizzed me to see if I could calculate how many pain killers I take in a month, and with no hesitation.. now I\u2019m terrible at maths and I tried to add it all up but wasn\u2019t quick enough. She pulled all my pain relief and gave me a tube of ibuprofen gel.I was in tears, went home and just didn\u2019t know what to do. I eventually called again and got an appointment with my original doctor. He was horrified and quickly adjusted all my prescription meds I needed to keep upright. He was furious but kept professional, I saw how frustrated he was about someone just erasing all the work he put in, and undermining him completely.Now due to the pandemic, I don\u2019t have to have appointments, and therefore no one has altered my prescription. I recently messed up a repeat and had to go a couple of days without gabapentin.. usually when I run out of something I get an emergency advance. BUT now gabapentin has been classified in the UK, you cannot get an advance, you can\u2019t get the prescription faxed, and you can\u2019t call up for an urgent prescription either. So I struggled through two days and oh boy, I would not want to do that shit again. It\u2019s really serious to just pull peoples meds, they don\u2019t take into account withdrawals, and how bad that can be. It can fucking kill you! And they act like they can just take everything away and you\u2019ll be fine because what? You\u2019re lying? Who would want to live like this, it\u2019s a nightmare. I\u2019m always in pain and not even all the pain relief I have can dull it all. A person can\u2019t fake that 24/7, it\u2019s just not viable and reasonable to believe that.Man, Iwishmy meds got me high, maybe I wouldn\u2019t care so much about being a giant ball of pain and stress. Doctors act like you\u2019re merrily running around high as a kite, loving life. That is so completely untrue about my life, I can\u2019t even explain it coherently. Seriously, anyone would choose something exponentially more fun than fucking pain killers, to get high. There\u2019s plenty of choice!",

The nurse at my gyno's office (funny enough the doc delivered me lmao) asked for my pain number and I said something like 12/10 because again. Agonizing. It was pressed against a ligament. She gave me a really weird look and when she left the room my mom quietly explained you can't say 10/10 they'll think you're a drug seeker.I was so confused. I was in pain. They asked me. And apparently I'm supposed to lie? It was incredibly confusing to little teen me. Luckily the gyno himself heard me and was like whoa somethings wrong. I believe it was his head nurse that got me pain meds before I even saw him too. So there's good people at that office but I will just never forget the look of the nurse that asked me the \"checking in\" questions in the room. I felt so ashamed - she looked so incredulous and mildly disgusted. I was just a kid.",

        "text": "I recently went to the ER last week due to a ruptured ovarian cyst in bleeding too heavy on my period. I have stage 4 endometriosis, but I was not supposed to bleed... I was put on progesterone to stop the bleeding and I ended up having a really severe period to the point where I passed out in my own blood. I also had a lot of pelvic pain, I was rushed via ambulance to the hospital. Once I got there, the doctor was so snarky and rude. Of course he was a male doctor, all the male doctors I have encountered at emergency are always sexist. I was explaining to him that I was bleeding more than usual and I'm not supposed to, and I'm in a lot of pain. I also throw up a lot when I'm in pain, that's normal for me. He said, \"well we can't really do anything for the pain but give you maybe a Tylenol.\" Then he was going to order a transvaginal ultrasound which already had one about a month ago through my OBGYN. On top of it I did not want to go through with it again because the pain level was literally over a 10 because I was curled up, vomiting, and ended up passing out before I was at the hospital. I was assertive and said back to him, \"I do not want that to go inside of me, I will not do that because I am already in severe pain that I cannot control, and that transvaginal ultrasound will cause pain more. You are already not giving me anything for the pain and I don't want to be in more pain.\" He says, \"well it is what it is, you have chronic pain and you have to learn to live with it and deal with it. We cannot prescribe a narcotics in the ER because you have chronic pain, and chronic pain is just mild discomfort you that cannot die from.\" That was his exact words, I could not believe what came out of his mouth I was in disbelief. I said no to the ultrasound and ended up AMA because I was not going to be treated like a criminal. I told my OBGYN about it who is a very good doctor and manages my pain. She said that I have to go to the hospital that she is through from now on, even though it's about 15 to 20 mi away from my house. The last time I went to their hospital was a year ago for surgery and they treated me so well.",

        "text": "God I feel you on the sucky lupus front. To explain that one it depends how it is affecting me:fatigue: someone suddenly switched my power off, and even holding my head up is a monumental task. Sleep doesn't make any difference, and even if I slept for 18 hours, which is likely, I wake up feeling exactly the same as when I went to sleep.joint pain: its symmetrical but may change locations on a daily basis, but I'll always have sonw joints that remain constant and will always hurt when I flare. If you've had a really deep bruise, that takes ages to come out but is really painful even before you can see the bruise, imagine that in your joints, and every time you move them only a few mm, you hit the bruise.neuro depends how it affects you, I get verbal and visual hallucinations, and that's pretty understood. The rest of the symptoms are pretty evident.Don't have a partner... can't stand people fussing when I'm flaring. Leave me crack on. I know what I can do and can't do and I'll say yes or no if people ask me to do things, but I actively don't want help at those points, it drives me mad.Hope you feel better soon. X",

        "text": "This may seem counter-intuitive, but simply explaining how the pain feels to an SO is not enough to improve the relationship if your mental health is also suffering. That's because no amount of understanding from him will be enough to help you get to where you want to be mentally (it would lead to co-dependence if you tried, which usually doesn't make for a healthy relationship). The most impactful thing you can do is start with your mental health first. Not only does that help you, but it also helps to set up a relationship for longevity by showing him that while you value and appreciate his support, you're not reliant on it. Speaking as someone who was your age a decade ago and had long-term relationships during periods of my diagnoses like you, the average person gets tired after a while if they feel like they're carrying too much of the other person's emotional load. They may seem really sweet and caring at first, but think about what that will look like after several years. If you're open to it, I'd strongly suggest finding a therapist that you really click with. Doing so can help you to make sense of your diagnoses, strengthen your coping skills, define what you want from your relationship, and formulate the best plan to communicate with your SO. I'll include a list oflow-cost and free therapy resourcesthat you can check out if you're interested.",

        "text": "I'm not going to address your questions, because I don't feel like I have any good responses.  However I thought I'd address something that might help with both.When I was your age I was sick as Hell with no diagnosis in sight. Getting a diagnosis for my systemic disease was still nine long years away. Getting one for the rare neurological disease that set me on the path to my lupus diagnosis was still six years away. But I had symptoms of both.Illness was rough on a relationship. It's a lot of stress to love someone like us. Having a diagnosis already might make it easier on our SO's.Being in a relationship with someone when you're both young and dealing with the stress of chronic illness in one or both of you is even harder.  The person who is sick feels awful, and just wants to rest. They're often depressed or have anxiety about the \"what ifs\" of this new life they're facing. The person who's not is young and healthy. They've never had a serious chronic illness themselves. It's easy to try to understand what their partner is going through for a little while, but after a while it starts to feel personal when the sick partner has to cancel plans, or is unable to do what both of you wish the ill partner could do. And after a while for both partners, it starts to feel like the healthy partner is being held back from living the life of a healthy person by the health needs of the ill partner.As we get older we're more likely to have more and more experience with chronic illness, in family we are close to or close friends. We're exposed to the effect it has on sick people, and we start to learn that when you have to cancel plans it isn't a personal affront to them. It doesn't mean we don't WANT to be living an active life with them. We just don't have a choice a lot of the time.With more experience in life behind us, interpersonal relationships become easier to have and maintain, thank God. I am now about one week from my 49th birthday, and while I haven't been in a romantic relationship in quite a while, it has had little to do with my health. I was blessed enough to work for my family's business, which enabled me to take time off to care for my grandparents when they were dying, and later my severely disabled cousin after she choked on a hot dog (she spent more than two years comatose following that incident before she passed away). It was hard work at times, but I was blessed to be able to do it and I'll never regret having done so. I got to know my grandparents in a way that my cousins never would, and I learned so much while taking care of my cousin.All that time I was quite ill myself, but didn't know what my illness was. However like most people, life experience made me more comfortable in dealing with illness. And the more experienced I became, the more patience I had in dealing with the illnesses of others. Even my own.So is there a way to explain how you're feeling that someone who isn't ill would understand? I don't think so. I think the ability to understand comes with life experience. And what could you tell your SO that you need from them when you are in a flare? I have no idea. That depends on far too many variables to give it a solid answer.Nonetheless, good luck going forward. Our roads are not easy ones, but they're not without many, many blessings. And maintaining a positive attitude as much as possible is crucial. When I was in college I figured something out, and made a crucial decision. I realized that I could walk around angry about what I was going through or I could CHOOSE to make the best of the situation. Walking around angry was incredibly self destructive. Choosing to find the good in even the worst situation would help me to have the best life I could. So I chose the latter.One thing before I go. Finding the good in even the most trying situations was a matter of choice. It was voluntary. It was all up to me. I had learned that while growing up, seeing a member of my family do just that. I saw that it worked well for him, so I decided to do the same. And I was able to teach that to others. Yet another blessing. And while I'm not currently in a romantic relationship, I have SO MANY wonderful friendships. Life isn't perfect, but it's usually pretty great. Do I have chronic pain? You bet. Anxiety? Yup. Am I low on energy a lot of the time? Yep. Do I wish I was more normal? No. I love who I am, and how blessed I am as well.I hope that helps.",

While ketamine is also commonly used to manage both acute and chronic pain, those applications typically involve higher doses than the subanesthetic levels used for mental health treatment.Ketamine actually has a long history of use. It was first approved by the FDA in the 1970s as a dissociative anesthetic and has been widely used in major surgeries for its pain-relieving and dissociative properties. This foundational role paved the way for its more recent applications in both mental health and pain management.If you\u2019re exploring ketamine therapy and wondering if it\u2019s the right fit, a consultation is a great place to start. A clinician can review your medical history, assess your symptoms, and help determine your eligibility while outlining a personalized treatment plan.Let me know if you have any other questions\u2014I\u2019d be happy to help!",

    "content": "Hello everyone, I\u2019m 19 years old and this year  I\u2019ve been having back issues for a few months and got a CT scan done which showed multiple intervertebral disc herniations and schomo nodes on nearly every level of the mid and lower thoracic spine, as well as  scoliosis to the right, and Multiple schmorl nodes on nearly Every level of the lumbar spine as well. And an accessory vestigial rib at the L1 vertebral body on the left as well as one on the t12 side. And last year diagnosed with gastroparesis, gerd, IBS. I have also been diagnosed with chiari malformation type 2, and hydrocephalus at age 3. And was just sort of wondering what everyone else does to manage pain?",

        "text": "Sooo do you have a diagnosis for Ehlers Danlos by chance? I have all of your issues plus a couple others and have Hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Type 3. If you don\u2019t, you should see a geneticist or rheumatologist to look into it. Especially to rule out the vascular type which can be very dangerous.So EDS is a very painful condition and obviously there are many comorbid issues that follow it. I follow a strict anti inflammatory diet, work with a great neurologist for exercises, have a physical therapist to help with alignment and improvement of strength, psychologist for the mental health aspect and most importantly an understanding pain management doc or GP with your history. I take tramadol for baseline pain, trazodone for jaw clenching (had a full jaw disc(s) replacement procedure) along with 12 other surgeries, many spinal. I have oxycodone for excessive pain as an emergency med. I\u2019ve had docs tell me to just take cannabis, do accupuncture etc. I\u2019m sorry but for my level of pain I HAVE to take pain medication or I can\u2019t care for my child.You will need a neurosurgeon specializing in EDS Fraser Henderson in DC or there is a new one in the Carolina\u2019s. I wish you all of the luck in the world! I pray you get a diagnosis because that\u2019s half the battle \u2764\ufe0f",

I can stand and walk without too much difficulty.Of course I can\u2019t walk too much cause my joints and back start causing me issues and I get a flare up, but at least I can walk a bit?I was recently put on new medication that has actually helped my pain while walking. Instead of barely being able to walk 1km, I can now walk 2km without feeling stabbing pain in my ankles!!Slight issue, with this new found power, I decided to try and walk parkrun (5km route) again. I have discovered that I cannot walk 5km.With walking 5km twice in 5 days, and sitting down for a total period of 11 hours for travelling (and seeing the theatre) with relatives, I\u2019ve managed to push myself into a flare up just for the new year!! (im suffering)I have another 4.5hr drive back home today. I am mid flare up. GG future meedit: hi its future me, finally home after 5.5 HOURS !!! there was more traffic than expected so we took so much longer than expected. i cried about 4 times from the pain and we stopped pretty much every 30mins for me to get out and stretch. everything hurts. i\u2019ve just gotten home and not only do i need to pack away a weeks worth of Stuff, I also need to MAKE MY BED because i washed my sheets before i went away \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

    "content": "I am 21, I had a bad case of scoliosis that was missed for 18 years that killed all my nerves and was crushing my organs. I needed a spinal fusion, which turns out it failed. Since then I\u2019ve had chronic pain. Basically, I got the surgery at 18, since got a neuromuscular disease from it, still scoliosis, kyphosis, minimum 6 herniated disks they haven\u2019t gotten my upper back pinched nerves, spinal stenosis, osteoarthritis, loose screws some other issues you get the idea. I just found out about the back issues recently, as my original surgeon has always told me it will go away. Basically primary tells me he is completely wrong we go through the process I\u2019ve seen 2 neurosurgeons and a spinal specialist, they see the herniated disks, osteoporosis, loose screws etc. they tell me from the mri my entire spine is degenerating (go into discussion about DDD not really a disease etc), that typically most surgeons only fuse a few vertebrae, and that my fusion is extremely extensive (I don\u2019t know the exact amount,  but I\u2019m fused from shoulder to a little above hip). They tell me typically they would just do surgery where\u2019s needed and for future fix the cause of what\u2019s making it degenerate, but in my case it\u2019s the rods/screws and that can\u2019t be changed and so I\u2019ll need yearly surgeries to keep it stable (I\u2019ve had 4 specialist tell me this, and that the surgery won\u2019t help the pain much in my case. Issue is, my body cannot handle the surgeries. The neuromuscular disease screws everything up, and they can\u2019t even say how I\u2019ll do through another one (almost died 10+ times during first fusion). Pain wise they have no issue giving me pain meds given the circumstance and have me on a fentanyl patch, oxycodone, and hydromorphine +medical marjuana for right now, but said this will most likely have to be kept long term. My question is does anyone have any advice to go about this, advice, has anyone taken mass amounts of pain meds for so long will my liver still be okay etc that idea, and what happens if I just don\u2019t get surgeries. Is it death what are my risks (surgeons and primary have dodged the idea and just given me a vague \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee you will live or what will happen.\u201d Nerves wise between the neuromuscular disease and discs and nerves basically everything\u2019s affected from muscles to using the bathroom issues to eyesight. If it won\u2019t help the pain what\u2019s the point is my point of view here. I don\u2019t have to worry about working I got a lot of money from a lawsuit from the missed scoliosis crushing my organs, so I can use the pain meds to control pain at home and have a semi okay quality of life of right now.",

        "text": "In your situation, I might eventually suggest an implanted medication pump. Tiny doses of medication become hyper effective when theyre put directly in to the spinal fluid. Thats an MME multiplier of significance if you look at parental dose values. Silly things that comparisons are, its still a significantincreaseof efficacy. Under normal circumstances I wouldnt suggest it to somebody your age, not any implant, because of the battery life issue. That means every so often they need to replace the implant, whatever it might be. Batteries are getting better. Id be more enthusiastic if they lasted 20 years. But they should be able to handle your pain for a while like that. Its not perfect, what is?As far as what happens, ,if you dont get the surgeries, if your spine issues are so severe its pushing your organs around, youre going to have problems with one of them eventually. Could keep you from breathing right eventually. Theres lots of ways this could get worse. How long it'll take, who knows? Just tackle them a day at a time.Let me put it to you this way: if you had to pick a type of drug to be on long term, from a safety perspective, its hard to get safer than an opioid. The big noise is all about addiction. Please. It should be about bowel blockages from chronic constipation, which is often addressed by otc remedies, I might add.If youre having problems with consistent bowel movements, its probably from the opioids. Lots of ways to address that. But that the major danger. An opioid is not going to destroy your liver like tylenol or your stomach or kidneys like ibuprofen. The only problem with them is they dont fix anything. Reducing your pain and thats about all theyre good for. Thats the whole point of these drugs. Hang in there.",

His neck has been fused and he takes pain meds for both daily chronic pain and migraines which pop up 1-2 times a week.Right now he is detoxing off his current pain med to switch to another - I think he\u2019s through the worst of the withdrawal but the pain is really starting to set in and he\u2019s not supposed to start taking the next med until Sunday.Has anyone been through this and if so what helped you the most? We have heat pads, his favorite pillow, a weighted blanket, and I\u2019ve offered to take him for a massage or to the Y to sit in the hot tub (he\u2019s not super inclined to get out of bed or leave the house understandably).",

It\u2019s hard on one hand because I just found an incredible apt I\u2019m supposed to move into this weekend (lol) but on the other hand making this decision has made me feel a million times lighter. I need to focus 100% of my efforts on recovery and finding treatment\u2026.but having the life I built for myself slowly chipped away at until there\u2019s nothing left anymore has broken me in ways I really didn\u2019t think I could be broken tbh.I\u2019m exhausted 24/7 and what sealed it for me was that I couldn\u2019t even get up to go to work this morning and then spent 1/2 the time I was there disassociating. I was just thinking what am I even doing this for - it\u2019s clear sitting all day is actively making me worse physically and mentally.",

I guess my neck is all sorts of wonky, though thankfully my lower back was almost completely normal.Said I have slight reversal of cervical lordosis, retrolisthesis two of the vertebrae, but osteophytosis and \u201cdisc space narrowing\u201d between c5-c6 and c6-c7 got me a little nervous because I\u2019m terrified it\u2019ll eventually resort to surgery. Has anyone had success with treating that/ any of these issues without surgery? If so, what worked?

I've been told by many doctors that discs can heal themselves over time, over a long period of time. For me, I've been really focused on working out and trying to put muscle around the area steadily and slowly but consistently. Basically, what they'd tell you in physical therapy, but then you also add your own things that work for you and be consistent with it. I don't think it solves any disc narrowing, but it might help support the areas around it. Just moving in general helped me, basically, treating the body as a machine that works better if all the gears are moving rather than not.I've also tried all the gadgets that one could buy and never found one that felt like it actually achieved anything long-term. However, I have found that getting traction work bi-weekly or maybe monthly, from a chiropractor does help ease the space on the discs over time, even if it is just so slightly.Obviously, you might already now all of this, and it might not help your long-term neck problems, but I think it just helps maybe prolong the inevitable for some of us... surgery.Future surgery, or future medical treatments and therapies is always going to to be better than past stuff.Anyways, shit sucks, I know.",

And then I remember that my 10/10 was: being woken up mid spinal surgery to check for nerve damage as the monitoring equipment failed, and subsequently waking up post reconstructive spinal fusion for scoliosis, fused T9-L4, ALL WITH A BROKEN IV THAT NOBODY CAUGHT FOR 4 HOURS, meaning I was receiving exactly ZERO pain medication during this time. I screamed myself raw, then I screamed myself into permanent vocal cord damage while begging someone to kill me, and finally I screamed myself into coding. A priest was called, I shit you not. All while a helpful nurse told my parents that I was scamming for drugs. And yes, you bet your sweet ass we sued the ever-loving shit out of that hospital and won.",

That\u2019s the best way I can describe it anyways. So I kept touching my face for a few minutes, decided my heart rate was acceptable, and that I wasn\u2019t having a stroke, so I rolled over and went back to sleep.

I hate it!  I still try occasionally, but the driving is what stops me every time.  The twisting to look behind at my blind spot, the gas and brake makes my back hurt from lifting and pushing with my \"bad\" leg.  I have drop foot on the left so it make it hard and I have to use mostly my hip to lift that leg and my thigh to \"push\" the gas/brakes.  Then there's the sitting in one position for any length of time.  Then, of course, the bumps and dips in the road.  Steering is hard because it pulls on my back as well.I don't want to give up driving, but it's looking bad for me.  In a few years I will probably have no choice.",

Pain - head, neck, shoulders, arms and hands make it uncomfortable on a great day - impossible otherwise. The unplanned flare-ups and cluster headaches are debilitating. I do drive to five doctors appointments a month. One every Monday morning \u2026 absolutely zero traffic. (Rural area commute to edge of big city). Once a month a more extensive commute to get my pump adjusted / refilled. Again, start in zero traffic, little traffic by the time I reach my destination\u2026and I am driving opposite of any traffic on the way home. I would so kill to ride my motorcycle, do a high-performance track day or just simply go somewhere other than a doctor\u2019s appointment.",

Even my daughter has stopped doing anything around the house. Her daddy got a job working with her, he lives with our oldest and her kiddo. So that has lessened the mileage on the car. Save this week. Their is down, am hoping that gear shift thingy just popped out. Trying to find a cheap mechanic on marketplace is annoying. Over half are scammers. So, now I'm driving them all to work and school. Even when my leg goes numb. Or, I don't even want to wear a shirt, much less get fully dressed. And I hate driving in the dark when it's raining.

    "content": "Alright....ive been a chronic pain patient for over a decade now and have been getting hydromorphone and oxycodone perscribed since about just as long. My spine is severely fucked on every level. Have gotten A shit on of MRI and all sorts of therapy for literally every section of my spine which every section has a severe issue....I used to not be insured and ride dirtbikes doing flips racing cars etc and flipped a jeep 5 times barely survived. Also used to ride alot of skateboards and bmx back in the day... Then i worked hardcore jobs like carpentry and building alot of houses throughout my younger life and was also in nursing for 6 years during all of covid which also almost killed me but i somehow managed to recover after a very long time.Ive tried everything literally everything but the pain is more than i can bare i cant sleep for days without opioids that was also before  i was ever perscribed anything....im still in my 30s but after seeing all the MRI all my doctors apologized and switched me on them asap ....and thank god for that....now to my dilemma....i would love to not be on this shit but i just cant stop the withdrawals are nothing and easy to combat and get over its the pain that sets in after that ruins everything for me. I just cant live my life without masking this pain....weed doesnt do jack shit except fuck with my perception way to much and doesnt even kill the pain one bit. I tried every med under the sun before coming to opioids and they literally are teh only thing that make me feel like i can go about my life like a normal person and not constantly be on edge and aggressive cause of the extreme pain or out of it after not being able to sleep for days....I wouldnt wish this shit on my worst enemy but ive come to the conclusion im just gonna be on this the rest of my life although i would love for that not to be the case...ive tried over 20 times but i just cant stick with it and hold my job or a normal relationship with anything...its horrible. Just wanted to hear if anyone has been in a similiar boat.",

I made the decision to taper all the way off after years of waking up in withdrawal every morning, despite only taking my meds exactly as directed and never more. If you're looking to change therapies, your doctor may be able to offer medical detox options like clonidine or buprenorphine/naloxone (be warned though, the latter will get you labeled an \"addict\" because it's primarily used for addiction treatment). I spent nine agonizing months gradually tapering until I was finally free \u2014 and the withdrawals continued for a while after that. The best advice I can offer is to talk to your doctor. You're on a stronger combination of meds than I was. I did my taper without supporting therapies, but you may need them if you choose to pursue this.",

    "content": "Chronic Pain Central Florida, The Villages, and out of meds. I'm on my last leg. Had two major back surgeries after major accident when hit my drunken and high driver. I've been in pain management over ten years and on patch and oral oxycodone 15. My mom decided to move to the villages North of Orlando.. Got her settled in and I know no one and an scared as I try to not show my pain as it makes my mom, who is 87, and I'm helping care for, feel extremely down. Can't reach my doctor in Palm Beach Gardens for almost 2 weeks. I've been out of meds for a week and my mom has big Christmas party, maybe her last, Sunday night at Spanish Springs and today is Saturday and no call from my doctor or nurses and no response to emails for over two weeks. I'm a retired PA and never ignored patients.. I've been 100 percent compliant and will try to find pain doctor in Central Florida but they told me it takes about 2 months. I've never ever reached out to talk to others but I simply can't make it without relief.God bless all who are year to listen and help. Bless you. This isn't the pain ibuprofen can take care of and I've already been through withdrawal, again, and am scared to go anywhere as I always stick to stupid rules.Thanks friends for listening.. Maybe someday I can help you. Vince in Florida in pain",

I have a list of disabilities that would literally have most people in bed every single day, but I'm expected to do everything and then some - all the time.I know we aren't supposed to compare. I know life isn't about what you get back from others. I get that. But it's so hard not to when I feel like I've had to scale Mt Everest and the people around me are mad they're scaling a sledding hill. They compare their lives to mine all the time and apparently having a dad that gives a shit means that I have it made. Newsflash, it doesn't! I'm very thankful for my dad and everything that he does for me but outside of utilities and phone/internet, I pay the yearly house taxes, and everything else for myself. It has NOT been an easy road. They apparently forget that my biological mother is a monster that I had to claw away from.I'm lucky if I've made 300/month for the last three months. I'm lucky if I can go do any work or get any chores done or go run errands. The truck needs brakes, and other work done. It makes a weird noise when I turn it, like the tires are rubbing but I can't afford to get that even looked at. I'll probably have to find a mechanic that has a \"no payment now, same as cash for six months\" kinda thing. I'm lucky to pay gas and get an oil change regularly so I can keep working to make whatever money I do make.I finally contacted a debt management program and I'm looking into lawyers for disability but this isn't what I wanted to do. I have busted my ass for the last decade+ to have independence and take care of myself. Instead, I've destroyed my body and literally have nothing to show for it outside of a couple pieces of paper and debt. LOL what a joke.My dad has his own medical problems and I don't know how long he'll be able to continue to work. I'm tired of feeling like I'm drowning and not being able to even complain about it to those I call friends because they're apparently drowning even more! Or them giving me stupid devils advocate arguments where I know they don't give a damn and they're just trying to argue. They're always surprised when I cut them off - devils advocate arguments are arguments! Not an alternative option and if they were really my friend they'd know that I've looked into and thought about almost everything they're gonna try to throw at me as those arguments.I'm thankful that I appear like I have my shit together and that I look \"normal\" enough that people think I'm fine but at the same time - I'm fed up and done! I'm dedicating my life to myself. No partners, limited friendships, limited family contact, just myself. Social media outside of reddit pisses me off. Nobody cares to try to understand anyways so I'm truly fine with that.(I've been in too much pain to go get my birth control from the pharmacy since I ran out on Saturday? and my dad has no problem getting my sisters meds because hers are at Walgreens but because mine aren't, it's too much, too confusing, he's not used to it. I finally got them today and I know this rant is because I'm kinda spiraling right now. PMDD and endometriosis are a wicked beast, on top of my other diagnoses. I'm about to go take my night meds and get ready for bed, I just really needed to vent into the void and maybe feel heard. Thank you for reading this far, if you've made it this far you deserve a kiss on the forehead and a very cozy, warm bed to sleep in tonight.)",

        "text": "You were in Peru too long. Of course, your moms US pain doc is going to have a problem if they find a drug they didnt provide on a drug test. Is water still wet?It should take about 2 weeks after last use, for the Valium to drop below detection thresholds. Im sure her doc will be upset, dont they have Ambien in Peru? The US doc would still be pissed off, but Ambien in urine is Ambien in urine. They would have been none the wiser had she been given the same drug.So what did the neurosurgeon say about surgery? Surgeons dont do long term pain management. So is she a good surgical candidate? If she can get rid of all this by picking up a surgical scar, it should be a good trade. No more medication hoops (hopefully) to jump through. Stop trying to fix this like a drug company sales rep.You really need to impress upon mom the need to take her pain meds in a more timely manner. She will have far better results catching it before the pain is \"dug in\". And you should also explain that tramadol is also an anti depressant, that makes any tramadol withdrawal double sucky and can also double up on unwanted side effects. Im sure you have seen antidepressant TV commercials where they warn about suicidal thoughts or ideas as a side effect early in treatment? It may not be the pain making her more emotional, it could all be Tramadol's fault. They do make a long acting Tramadol, if that matters.Whats the dose, if its not prying? I do believe they still make a 25mg tramadol, but therapeutic doses run between 50mg-100mg per dose, 3 or 4 times a day. I dont know where mom falls on that spectrum, but it'll give you an idea of where the doc may go next. When you get down to it, only the correct dose is the correct dose. As determined by your doc, not your pain. Otherwise you can end up beating a dead horse over a medication that sucks for her pain and will never work, regardless of dose.Is it your intention to sit in on the next doctor appointment? I hope so. They should find your observations about mom useful. The suggestions for care, maybe not so helpful, in fact I wouldnt say a word about medication, and stick to what youre seeing mom go through. We often miss a lot of that, being the patient in the fishbowl...Is your mom concerned because shes taking an opioid drug? Its an attitude thats been carefully cultivated for decades by DEA and the addiction treatment industry. They only succeeded in making street drugs more dangerous than ever. Since street drugs are a problem the DEA cant handle, they blamed what they have control over (Rx drugs and doctors) and make them out to be the bane of human existence, so they can swoop in like General G.A. Custer, to save the day... and DEA couldnt even do that right. Didnt they think some doctors might notice everything they claim is complete bullshit? Opioids ineffective for pain? They sure didnt ask anyone in pain. Get real, you know? But people will believe anything these days...Apologies for the detour. Yep your mom will have problem with her US doc if she pees dirty for a drug they didnt Rx. They are not unaware of \"drug tourism\", so especially with a trip to South America, theyll see it s an opportune time to test, like on your birthday, or now, during office party season. And if you think moms having a tough time hanging on now, if her US doc drops her, she'll really lose it...So I take it waiting the 2 weeks isnt an option? You might be okay at a week, a great deal will have to do with the manner of drug testing her US doc uses, if they send it out to a lab-lab, I wouldnt bank on a less than 2 weeks.Why didnt your mom have her Ambien? It better have fallen out of the plane. I dont know how youre going to explain that so it doesnt sound like a \"drug vacation\". I mean that in the abusive sense, not the medical sense, since they sometimes refer to drug rotation as a \"drug vacation\". Thats the tough part, why didnt she have her meds?  If you went for a couple months...I've been to southern Peru, you dont just go for the weekend. Make that abundantly clear. It still may be an issue, but under the circumstances, mom probably should have asked for Ambien regardless of what the Peruvian doc suggested. We wouldnt be having this discussion, interesting as it is...",

For at least the last 10 years the DEA cut production quotas by 10%-30% yearly. They screw up everything they touch, just look at the wholesale poisoning of street drugs with fentanyl. They dont know one end from the other, since their brains are full of shit and their ideas come from their asses. They spent 40 years chasing a nonexistent Rx drug problem while fentanyl killed thousands. They have a vested interest in keeping alive the myth of Rx drug abuse, when people find out the DEA did nothing about fentanyl till 2018, 40 years after it started showing up on the street, people will get angry. Most folks dont even know fentanyl in street drugs is not a recent development. China White was a legal import for a long time 4 decades. While the DEA was busy playing doctor.You seem involved enough to know you wont get an answer about  Rx stock from the pharmacy on the phone.

I want to be able to say how I am without it sounding like a complaint.I have to take opioid pain medication to manage my pain so that I can function. A fair measure of it. I have it under control, in that I don't ever, ever run out of meds before my prescription renews. But I have been taking it constantly for more than five years. I sometimes wonder who I would be without the drugs. Aside from crying in pain, how does that guy think and feel? I have no idea. I am curious although I certainly do not want to try to find out.",

I have osteoarthritis in idk how many joints now and my left tmj is medically \"destroyed\".I said to my rheumatology nurse I was struggling with pain and she said I needed grief counselling.Have been told going on a juice diet would fix it by someone with arthritis and he was saying it made him be able to walk but he was on 40mg steroids so...?Have been told, \"doing more exercise could cure it. You never know.\"Going for a 10-15min walk flares up my knee. I have to be careful how much I do to not damage my joints further let alone how tired I am from life in general but sure, I'm just not doing enough exercise.A lot of the things suggested like yoga and meditation are wonderful and have made my relationship with my body so much more positive. Yoga and meditation haven't cured it or taken it away but they sure as shit have decreased the amount of suffering due to the pain.Its so tiring having chronic pain. I dont even know sometimes if I am in pain, but my body feels kind of fuzzy. Almost like I'm so used to it that it doesn't register as pain but I get stress in my chest and anxiety wondering.",

I should be living independently, but I can't work full-time and I had nowhere to go.They made me switch rooms because another resident fought with her roommate. They're refusing to help me. So I tried to do it myself and the pain was just unbearable. I didn't sleep all night. I still feel awful. My back hurts so bad. My legs are killing me, like a shooting, sharp ripping pain. I think I pulled a muscle. I was throwing up. So the next day, I went to urgent care. It was awful. They wouldn't let me lay down, and sitting in a chair was just awful. I couldn't sit anymore, I was crying and I went around finding people to ask them for a place to lay down, I didn't give up after being told no over and over.Finally I got a room to \"lay down\" (it was sort of sitting up but still better than a chair) the doctor saw me for all of two seconds and wouldn't listen to anything I had to say. He prescribed diclofenac 1% and left. Thanks a lot asshole.I just laid there in so much pain I was somewhere between sobbing and screaming.They finally checked me out. So today will be the third day I'm trying to move. I'm telling the staff here that they need to send someone to help me, I don't care who. I can't do this. I can't walk down those stairs anymore. I regret going to urgent care. My friend told me to go. I was hoping they'd at least look at me and tell me if I'm injured or how badly.TLDR: I hurt myself moving, and I can't get anyone to help ne even though I live in semi independent housing and the staff should help me. I went to urgent care and they didn't help me.",

I explained how she only had to give birth once and my pain is daily non stop and will probably be with me forever. She thinks she's coming to my wedding to my wedding next year LOL. I just can't deal with healthy people anymore.

Medicare wants me to do step therapy of drugs that aren\u2019t recommended for me as I\u2019ve had cancer. Yes, my Dr (great Doc) can appeal, however who she works for is pushing her to see more patients = less time spent on her current patients so it\u2019s been 7 mos since we initially discussed.My current injections may stop beginning January 2025 as I\u2019m required by PAP to apply for Social Security\u2019s new   \u201cextra help\u201d program and provide them with hard copy of denial letter which I understand takes 3 months to get. I don\u2019t qualify and PAP won\u2019t accept a screenshot of the application where it stops at a certain point and states \u201cyou don\u2019t qualify\u201d So, I feel the ship sailed for chronic pain patients already.

Unfortunately I turned to food and started binge eating and having large portions of food. It was the dopamine boost to deal with the pain. Last year I quit that and lost weight. Even now after stopping the binging and lowering my portions when I have high pain days I just want to eat. It\u2019s a non stop struggle. There\u2019s really nothing they can do about my arthritis at this point. I now find ways to distract myself. I read a lot at least a book a day sometimes longer books over 3-4 days.

Not necessarily the next day,But I've managed to dial back with it and have gotten to a point where I don't get drunk, I don't pass out in positions that make my pain worse, or jack up my sleep.\u00a0I don't have hangovers the next day that make my pain even shittier than it already is.I drink 4-6 spaced out from 5pm to 2am, with water in between.

    "content": "Hi there, I (f21) am almost in tears after listening to a podcast about the UH murder case, which most of you are familiar with I think. Even though I don\u2019t live in America, I am very saddened by what I hear about the healthcare industry there. But more so, I got very emotional over Luigi Mangione\u2019s case. For context, about 4 years ago, I started having an intense pain and the symptoms of what is called an urinal tract infection. But the problem was that in fact I didn\u2019t have one. Months went by and all the tests came back negative, but the pain was still there. I remember having to go to the toilet maybe 40 times a day and it was nothing but I still felt the urge to go every second. After many doctor visits and procedures I was told that maybe I have interstitial cystitis. I was only 18 yo. I remember being so jealous of people because they did not know they had the privilege of not having to feel pain every second of their life. I wanted nothing more but to die honestly. I was so depressed, I could not see why I should live on. And it was excruciating. Really. I could not have intimate relations due to that, so I thought that no one would want to stay with me. I was lucky. My mom found a cure for me after trying god knows how many treatments (both standard and holistic). My body was in fact very inflamed (I also have psoriasis and cystic acne, or I used to). I cut some alergens and like a miracle everything started going away little by little. 3 years later and I still need to go to the toilet maybe 3 times before I go to sleep or more if I am agitated. Sometimes I remember that year and the pain and it feels like a fever dream. But not everyone gets to feel that. There are so many people who get diagnoses which they know cannot go away no matter what, or even if they can, they just won\u2019t. I remember wanting to do unimaginable things because of chronic pain. My heart goes out to all of the people who are going through this, I hope that you may find the way to remission! And even if that is not possible, we are here for you! Just do whatever feels good for you, you deserve it!",

The last time I went to the emergency department, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the provider treated me. He immediately asked me what IV pain medication would help me the most and what dose I needed. When I expressed my gratitude, he told me, \u201canybody prescribed to the narcotics you are prescribed that has the diagnoses you have deserves to be able to tell me what they need.\u201c I was beside myself. He meant it, too. Over the course of 18 hours he gave me exactly what I needed, and he personally saw to it that the hospitalist admitting me understood my needs, as well. I spent 13 days there, 11 of them on a PCA, also getting IV pushes on top of it every three hours. I\u2019ll never forget that doc.",

Between her severe neuropathic pain condition and a horrifying amount of physical abuse growing up, plus just some bad luck incidents (serious car accident, botched epidural during childbirth) she has basically been dealing with excruciating pain I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her whole life, and the result is she\u2019s incredibly stoic and unflappable.On the occasions her pain spikes to the point we need to go to a doctor she is always very calm and collected while enduring pain that would bring me to my knees in a heartbeat. This invariably leads the doctor to dismiss her because \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem that bad.\u201d I keep having to interject on her behalf and say \u201cshe rated it as a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10, a 6 for her would be an 11 for you or me. She needs treatment.\u201dSometimes after she says her 6 they\u2019ll dosomedue diligence and ask \u201cwhat do you consider a 10,\u201d but her answer is always somewhere along the lines of a very matter-of-fact \u201cwell when I was a kid my mom beat me with a golf club, I guess I\u2019d call that pain at least a 9.\u201d I keep telling her that they have no idea what to do with that information because it\u2019s not a situation they encounter often, so maybe just try saying the punctured lung from the car accident was a 10. But then she gets all serious and says \u201cno, that was more like a 5 or so.\u201d",

After 6 ER trips in a few months, a possible doshnosisbfor 10 different things all requiringna specialist, and on my own research - a possible gluten allergy, but no real answer. I cut out gluten and noticed  a HUGE differnce in how I felt. I have not fully cut out cannabis as it does immensely help with sleep. I didn't have insurance until this year so I have my first PCP visit and hopefully GI visit soon after to get an idea of what the hell is still going on.My poor partner has dealt with the constant bathroom trips, whether I am taking a bath or shower to help with pain or anxiety or to just relax- or waking up 6 times throughout the night because I cannot get comfortable. I talk way more about feeling bad than I really should, and me feeling bad makes it hard for me to check in with HER.I do not want to lose her. She has expressed some things can be very lonely or exhausting on her end as well- which I fully understand.How can I make things easier on her- when I'm having a hard day or three?we both work from home full time and i contribute evenly to bills. I'm only mentioning this so it is clear that as far as finances go- she is not alone in that. I also take the lead on things like grocery orders as that can be overwhelming for her and I enjoy those tasks.I do my best to maintain the apartment and pets even when having a tough day, but can tend to leave small messes. I have ADHD so this is something I am aware of and actively work on, I do tend to forget my socks I took off in the middle of the bathroom floor after a shower for example.we have a small apartment with one restroom which is my go to place for comfort. This is my biggest hurdle. I don't WANT to feel tied to it on bad pain days- but the reality of my situation is that is my quickest and most efficient method of calming my anxiety AND pain right now. But it triggers her and that is understandable as it has been ongoing for a few years.Any advice so I don't drive her crazy -but also address my own feelings?",

    "content": "67 yr old male. I have a ton of chronic pain.  Both the explained kind from herniated discs in my neck and lower back, tear in my rotator cuff, worn out knees. But also a periodic unexplained generalized pain that makes all those already mentioned injuries hurt all the more and just throbbing pain throughout my whole body- my hands, hips, feet, all my vertebrae, wrists/elbows - basically all my joints in my whole body.  This comes and goes in kind of flares.  I can\u2019t find rhyme or reason. Been to all my doctors - primary has no explanation, took all the blood tests and all negative.  Went to rheumatologist and he says fibromyalgia- but I\u2019m skeptical.  He is confident that I don\u2019t have any autoimmune issue. I cannot take Advil because it hurts my stomach. When I take Tylenol, it helps very slightly, same with Celebrex.  But what is so strange is that after I take Tylenol or Celebrex, my aches go from a 6-7 at worst to 10!   My doctors say that is impossible.  No way it\u2019s a rebound effect.  Essentially I am just imagining the increase in pain.  Any one else experience anything like this?  Any thoughts on what is causing my full body pain?  Thanks",

I've tried everything on \"The List\" - you know the one (Injections, PT, Surgeries, Dry needling, acupuncture, chiropractor, massage. ETC).I took the recommended dose for high pain.  A few hours later I was crying from the pain relief.  I had no idea how deep in the pain hole I was.  It was like I had my brain back, my mood improved, I was cracking jokes with my wife.Up until that point I had just giving up, flirting with idea of suicide.  I had been coming up with an \"exit\" strategy to \"leave\" my wife and kids but couldn't leave them in a bad financial situation.  I told myself just a few more years of this then my kids and wife could have jobs of there own and I can \"leave\".I still remember my most recent pain management appointment.  After trying 2 medications that didn't help at all with my pain.  They said there is nothing more we can do for you.  With tears in my eyes - begging for help being ushered out the door - The doctor goes \"You should try turmeric\".Now I'm pissed and want to fight now that I know relief is possible.  I do not want to kill myself.There is a new pain management office that opened closer to home I want to try.  Any advise on how to talk with the Doctor about my pain journey?  I don't even know if I should mention the suicidal ideations from pain.  They may see that as drug seeking.",

I don't know how telling them you take kratom will effect them. I also take kratom because I was told same as you, that they can't help other than antidepressants and muscle relaxers, niether of which helps me. I can't function on muscle relaxers and antidepressants all make me sick, sleep or more depressed on top of the pain.Kratom can be addictive so same rules as stronger opiates. Be careful about increasing dose frequently. Try to take minimum effective dose as infrequently as possible. If you find a good dose/schedule try to stick to that and accept that some days will be bad days, some amount of pain is expected. Be careful with mixing it with anything else. I've taken 2.5g every 4-5 hours for years. I figure it can't be worse than when I was taking 3500 mg tylenol and 2500 mg ibuprofen daily. My annual liver checks always good on my physicals.",

        "text": "This is where I was at earlier this year. And believe me when I say I tried it all from muscle relaxers to injections that took walking away for the past year.  I was even smoking weed all day every day to the point that stopping took months to feel like myself again. The si was intense.I had a therapist that I was honest with them about the si but since I never told her I had a plan she didn't admit me. I say admit the si but mention that you don't have a plan ' even though I did' because they really take it seriously and I believe have been extra helpful to get back to me the same day when I reach out. I was taking up to 4 grams of kratom a day. I knew my exact grams which was important because I made my own one-gram pills with a 000 machine. It was much more affordable than weed.My favorite strains were red mengda for day and red bali for night.  On top of 300 mg of edibles, I found in 100 mg pills. My pain got to the point that was taking so much kratom and weed that I was afraid to travel and losing my hair. I also wasn't sleeping. When I went to pain management I was scared that I was at the point I felt like I needed opiates.They told me that since I was only taking 4 grams instead of 40 grams of kratom I didn't count for true substance abuse but I did get moderate cannabis disorder. That hurt because I saw weed and kratom as the miracle that kept me from the noose. They started me on butrans patches and I finally got to sleep for the first time in years. I'm now posts hip surgery and have been on hydrocodone, tramadol, we increased the butrans patch to 20 mcg per hour, and I was still taking tizanidine to sleep at night. The last two weeks have been hell my back pain is back and I'm unable to hold my pee. So today I started suboxone and I'm having the same experience of crying bec im finally out of pain. I wish you the best. If you need surgery they will be awful about getting off kratom and weed.The reason i finally got help was when i did ketamine at a clinic and the asked me to go off kratom and that's really when it sunk in that I'm dealing with way too much pain.  For the kratom, make sure to add stool softeners they have cheap huge bottles at costco and  or miralax bec it does make it hard to go.I wish they recognized it as helpful because I really miss it when my other meds stopped working but if you find a good pain management team to give the meds they offer a try and being honest about what is happening like not sleeping and peeing oneself, they won't leave you hanging over holidays and weekends it is worth it to try the things they recommend.If they do leave for someone else bec the si from pain is so very real and when pain is managed its the only cure for it. Dm if you like. I have lots of tips about kratom and meds that pain management might make you try before they give stuff that works like methocarbamol, cyclobenzapine, and tizanadine.Edit: spelling .  Also getting it from a reputal source is best. If you can go into a store that has some one who know and is in pain and usually o ly sells kratom i have found those to be my best sources. The head shops where ok but the results varied.",

Have any of you ever heard of low dose naltrexone? If I was going to waste time at pain management that's the one thing I would ask about the steroid shots all of that are really not good for you at best they are a Band-Aid however it's a Band-Aid that will not work for everyone and doctors can't even see their head out of their ass to be honest about that therefore it's hard for me to want to waste my time. If I was going to though I would ask about that low dose naltrexone it is not the same thing as Suboxone so don't let anyone tell you it is but it's been shown to slow down the progression of autoimmune diseases and to give people immense pain relief it's worth checking out also any of you who have pain due to autoimmune disease or degenerative disc disease if you want to learn more it's not hard to get a membership to medscape any person can say they're a doctor and make an account I wish that we didn't have to do things like that because it's time consuming for a lay person to try and learn all this terminology but for people like me I have an autoimmune condition that's pretty rare I have to if I don't want to be gaslit and I don't.",

        "text": "JUst be cool how you approach the Kratom at the new practice. Its becoming common to test for it, and they look for something weird, not mitragnya, but another metabolite, so it takes about 10 days to leave your system on a urine drug screen. Keep that in mindThe thing that should really make you mad is that there is far better pain control than Kratom that they have withheld. Everyone makes such an unnecessary fuss over opioid drugs. It amazing how people will want to argue Kratom isnt an opioid, but it most definitely is, with all the useful risks of other opioids. Keep that in mind and you should be okay. There is one concern about Kratom that you should be aware of, thats the possibility of heavy metal poisoning, specifically manganese, found in Kratom, even with the Kratom Association Seal of Approval. That can cause brain damage, but Tylenol can poison your liver. We all gotta die of something. We just hope its not painful...I dont want to get in to the history of the so called opioid crisis, but it will be the invisible elephant in the exam room. If youre not aware of the sources of pressure on doctors to treat pain with Spice (I think they all read too many Dune books), the main protagonist is the DEA, since they control the license to prescribe, not state medical boards or even other doctors. Thats how policemen got to overrule doctors, in the first place. Before all this baloney we only had to fight with insurance to pay for treatment. Oh btw, the record is full of denials from DEA that they influence medical treatment. Holding a knife to doctors throats isnt influence, I guess. But you should discuss this and more with your doc, if you want to feel them out. They might be violently anti opioid. They might see opioids as the right treatment but feel their hands are tied. Or they might even understand this is a manufactured fraud to cover up the shitty job DEA did with fentanyl in street drugs. And they continue to do a shitty job. But if all they know is what the DEA is shoveling, they could very well be hostile.I would expect them to want to do injections or PT, every doc thinks theyre William Tell with a syringe. \"You havent had a block till Ive done one on you.\", seems to be a common thought in the pain clinic. If its been a while it might even help some.I would try to use this as an occasion to get some updated imaging done, if its been a while since the last MRI. Degenerative, means its not going to stay as it was, unfortunately...You need to approach this opioid thing from the pain side by telling them how the pain's effecting you. The psychological effects of long term pain are what separates it from acute pain.Should you tell your doc about suicidal thoughts? Its almost certain to lead to some sort of counseling, which isnt a bad idea. Its also going to scare them that if they give you strong pain meds, you might use them to off yourself. Which is a pretty unfair assumption, since they really dont understand the doses required, especially if youre already opioid tolerant. Some of us would have to clean out NIH's drug vaults to OD. Its not a realistic fear, with therapeutic sized doses.If you dont mention drugs there's no way anyone can accuse you of drug seeking. Talk about your pain and how it affects your quality of life.What does the pain prevent/make difficult/do to you, daily, that leads to these feelings? Forget the 1-10 scale if you have been using it. It doesnt say anything about your pain. Thats the sort of thing you need to throw at them, you need to tell them about your pain, even the heartache. They should want to treat you psychologically, there's a lot pain does to you psychologically that affects you physically. Things like dumping adrenaline in to your system at the wrong times. But they need to physically address the pain as well. You cant address this kind of pain by only looking at half the problem. You need to address the physical and psychological, because its all really interconnected. Dont let your doc treat only one aspect of this pain....Best of luck..",

Eg not mentioning ANY drug names, making sure you state all the epidural physiotherapy treatments and needles etc and wait to see what the Dr offers\u2026. They said to look online as some dr offices will say no pain Rx on their website hence may not be worth a visit\u2026. I\u2019m so sorry, no wonder people go to such huge extremes with such tight restrictions on medicines\u2026. As if it was the people not the Sackler family greed that caused this terrible affliction and surely best to just have strict guidelines  but at least allow genuine pain people to access medications which ease their sufferings\u2026. Surely safer than lining the cartels pockets and all the misery endured by people crippled by pain\u2026. The Kramtom sounds like it really helped but please heed the warnings of alternate days use and the same amount, one person was spending thousands on it as had got totally out of control for them\u2026 I really wouldn\u2019t mention it to any Dr they\u2019ll run a mile\u2026. Please have a look back through todays posts it was someone who had run out of their medication and advice re the pain clinic\u2026..",

Even better is morphine and it\u2019s various derivatives. The primary molecule in Kratom responsible for this action is widely known as 7OH, and is easily bought in the USA. It is estimated that 7OH is 13x stronger than morphine, mg for mg.Things are in a terrible state when your pain doctor won\u2019t go near opioids, knowing how life changing they are for some people. Patients like this are left to discover things like Kratom by themselves. Very unfortunately, I don\u2019t think it will be very long until Kratom is made illegal to purchase without a prescription. The subr/quittingKratom shows the potential it has to be very addictive if not used carefully for legitimate chronic pain.",

As I looked I realized the dog is just bored and need something to chew on and need some toys that's nothing to do cuz that's what sort of told me think it even brought me a half to the root.

Many are just the lyrics, but I've been going through them, and I've got about half put to music. One of my cousins was a country singer and released three or four albums before he died (something sort of congenital heart problem). The highest he ever charted was #14. He recorded a duet with Travis Tritt on his debut album.My grandfather was a studio guitarist and backed people like Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, and Waylon Jennings. In fact, I inherited all of his instruments, including a guitar he was given by Merle Haggard. I wish I could play like he did!I just released a Christmas album this month with 9 original songs. On December 26th, I have a worship album dropping. That one is 12 original songs. I'm also working on some children's songs. Both completed albums are on Spotify, Amazon Music, Pandora, and pretty much every streaming service.If anybody is interested, you can DM me, and I'll send the Spotify link. I dont know if this sub allows links to streaming services or not. I'm not doing these songs for income specifically. They are my therapy, so to speak.",

    "content": "So I like to text a lot and talk to people because I don't sleep at night in pain. Some of you have have talked to me when I asked for help at night thank you. But I also like animals and so I got on an app a neighborhood to find out what was going on in the neighborhood since I'm basically a shut-in. As I've gotten sicker I think I'm ugly cuz I don't dress up but don't look good my roots have gone out so my hair is different color. I'm not cute slim and small like I used to be. I don't like the way I look. I don't have any mirrors in the house. Well I'm texting on this and neighborhood app I got to talking to this one gentleman I don't even know how I got to talk to him but I kept talking to him. And even after he moved I kept talking to him and he sent me his new phone number and we started phone chatting and we said we'd be friends. It's been about a year now and he wants to video chat he wants to come back and have dinner with me? Everybody with chronic pain knows you don't really want to have sex. Just thinking about that the way my back is not going to happen. And what's the doctor want to take my pain medicine away definitely wouldn't happen. I don't know if any of you know this but if you're on oxy it really decreases your sex drive along with the pain medicine. But when you go off the oxy there's a rebound effect and suddenly Billy Bob Thornton on landman on land looks hot. And I was late as a creep. Not my medicines being reduced. And I have a slight problem coming back. But I still feel extremely ugly. I'm afraid that once that person looks at me even on the video they're going to say no way. And we all want to be attractive to someone even when we're sick. Maybe not all the time but sometimes. If you're shutting like me because you're in pain all the time or you can't move around you can't drive and you've withdrawn for many years your body changes your personality changes. Sometimes you're still lonely and you want somebody to desire you. Masters and Johnson came up with a theory that they said there's nothing more desirable than being desired by someone or wanted. All right so then I got this problem this guy wants to come back to town on the weekend and go out on a date. I can't let anybody see me. I still really like talking to him. She's really smart and that's hard to find really smart guys when you gone to grad school and get gone there twice for 2 degrees. And you talk to other people but they don't sort of talk about some of the stuff that people do to go to grad school and I get lonely sometimes. And he's up at night and we text. But now what do I do? People help guys are out there in the chronic pain community whether you think? I mean this is not like a person that would like somebody in chronic pain even though I've told him I'm sick okay I haven't lied except they haven't shown in my face in the last 2 years when I got really really sick of changed a lot. He's got a picture that's 2 years old but I've changed drastically. The medicine it changes your hair your face your body nobody would recognize me now comparing me to a picture of just two years ago. So what I do what do I say he's going to text me tomorrow and he's going to want to answer. Help?",

        "text": "L3-4 is the big issue. Damage to the actual disc is not fun. If the bone continues to deteriorating you'll have some nasty issues. I broke 5 vertebra in an accident 20+ years ago. I had chips, etc. pulled out in the first surgery, and they stabilized my spine. I healed nicely. At first. Then, the bones started to melt, and I found my spine deteriorating. More surgery (5) now at 64. I have no feeling in my feet,  legs, and bum. Now, hands are getting numb. Good luck.",

        "text": "So, your result is like mine pre-June 2024. My back was \u2018stable\u2019 for about 15 years like that. Biggest thing, 180 degrees for your back and legs and 90 degrees, ie: standing and sitting are your friends.Bending over just slightly is the worst thing for your back.Now, what can you expect? Random shooting pains, seizures of muscles, weird sensations, feeling like your bones are going to explode from pressure, and eventually loss of bladder control.The good news is that just 1 bad disc will qualify you for ssdi, and you can still work while receiving it. The bad news is that no dr is going to perform surgery until you\u2019re basically bedridden or paralyzed, (you can see a previous post of mine).You can also get pain meds a bit more easily, I\u2019d suggest methadone, oxy, and gabapentin, but that\u2019s up to you.As for what it means, your disc is putting pressure on the nerve, so from about your kidneys down is going to have weird things happen.The other thing it\u2019s saying is that your vertebrae isn\u2019t collapsing (yet) but like I said, mine took from about 2007 - 2024.",

Too much fucking crippling pain the last few days. Struggling to do life like normal but it hurts so God damn bad. I can't possibly ask my husband for one more ounce of care he's putting up with so very much. Playing nurse to me for my wound, taking care of the home, going to work.I'm just not able to keep up my end of the game at this moment. I'm letting my son down so much. He resents me for the level of care I'm needing at the moment that just requires him to bring me things because I can't freaking walk at the moment. I'm ruining his newly found 18 yr old freedoms in life.  I'm short tempered and my brain is still just so damn scattered from the sepsis.   I'm fucking heartbroken that absolutely no one in my family has helped an ounce with this new situation. I just can't take the pain of being unloved and a burden to those in my life.Today will be a wallow in pain and misery kind of day because tomorrow I'm going to go back to doing as much as fucking possible because I can't stand the disappointment I see in their eyes. My husband has been the only person truly caring for me. I FUCKING HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS. CANT WAIT TO GO BACK TO MY NORMAL PAINS. FUCK THIS STUPID FUCKING BODY AND FUCK THOSE SHITTY PEOPLE IN MY LIFE. THINGS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AFTER THIS. I WILL NEVER LIFT A FINGER TO HELP ANY OF THEM EVER AGAIN.",

    "content": "I've been experiencing chronic pain since March 2023, about 20 months.I've had a workup of diagnostic tests, and everything has come back normal except for some small findings on my past colonoscopy/endoscopy. There were lots of ulcers, so much so the doctors were convinced it was Crohn's based on any visuals they had. The biopsies denied any evidence of Crohn's, but since I research damn near every second, I found someone who had both of those scopes come out perfect, only to find out after a lot longer that she did have Crohn's, but in her small intestine where they didn't find it until much later.One pain management doctor told me that the pain would go away with the ulcers, but two months later and I'm still in the same crippling, debilitating pain as usual.Has anybody else had a similar experience with Crohn's? Most of, if not all of my symptoms are signs of Crohn's/Ulcerative Colitis. Just wanted to ask if anybody had a Crohn's diagnose denied and then found later. Thanks!",

But its not uncommon for an opioid to feel \"speedy\" at the start.I had the worst insomnia of my life from a long acting opioid called Exalgo (hydromorphone ER). If this continues to be a problem beyond a couple months  (I'd hope it would be gone in a few weeks, but every body is different), let your doc know, there are lots of analgesic options besides ER morphine. Hysingla (hydrocodone ER) would be a pretty close substitute strength wise and might not give you the jitters. Its almost certainly more expensive. Check the web site if it get to that point, any \"name brand drug\" usually has coupons to save you a lot of money, if your insurance doesnt kick it back.I had some roommates in my younger days, who were IV heroin addicts. When they got high,  they'd clean the apartment top to bottom, for hours from the energy boost. Followed by 3 hours of nodding in a chair...Its not unusual at all. But with an Rx, side effects like that dont last. You would have to continually raise the dose to keep the speedy effect going...",

My last therapist was awful with chronic pain but I really needed her to help me process my relationship with my mother and I think the consultation was really helpful because I was able to be like \u201cthis is the approach I\u2019m looking for\u201d and she was able to be like \u201ccool that\u2019s my preferred approach\u201d.In general therapy is an important part of my pain management even if I\u2019m not talking about pain. It helps to be able to work through stressors in a healthy way\u2014 it\u2019s more of a prevent-mental-health-related-flare-ups and also a less depression = more activity = less pain.Therapy won\u2019t cure you but I think it\u2019s a helpful tool in the bag.",

No one believed me something was off until that happened. I just got so used to sucking it up and pretending I was okay I nearly let myself die. And here I am now trying to play down my chronic pain to be polite and fit into society all over again. It's a headspin",

Doctor would randomly touch a knee front or back and asked me where. Every now and again he hit it with their mallet tool in different spots on both knees.  Hit right leg, reaction was in left leg. Emg was no problem found.  He ordered full spine mri with contrast and I got my answers.  (Luckily now if they use a t4 mri contrast is not needed) my spine is full of empty sockets blocking csf flow.  My nerve bundle all the way up is inflammed.  Probably due to 62yr old case of meningitis that never really cured. Next time I need a spinal tap they will test this theory out. The end of your spinal column  where the nerves leave the spinal column  and head into lower gut organs and legs has what they call cauda equina. Basically damaged nerves clumped together by scar tissue. Some of these nerves protection layers are shot and signals are getting crossed.  Inflammation caused this.  Fun side is showing off the knee thing to little kids, bad side is loss of full control over bladder and bowels and legs.",

(Think fainting and or vomiting, not being able to move without either of the two happening etc.)I'm not saying don't try it,  and I'm not saying it can't work,  I genuinely don't know.  But I do want to urge you to be careful,  and don't lose the ability to tell your limits/ know your body. You can't just push through pain,  and even if you pretend it's not there,  it can still ruin your body,  even if you seem okay for a while.I'm always for trying anything that can make things better, but please be careful with things like this!

Then how we can tell our brain that we are okay.The major thing I took from it is how much control we have. Step back and watch your pain without judgement. It's really weird because it changes. For me, the pain becomes... tingly, almost? It is a very unusual feeling to play with the pain, by changing it.

You have to tell them and you better have more to talk about your pain than just a bunch of meaningless numbers. Your quality of life is what you need to discuss (well written, btw)  but they cant mind read that either. I think you have some pretty good foundational stuff, but youre trying to make a case for drugs instead of pain control. I know you dont mean to, but all this opioid stuff comes down to medical paranoia, so you have to be careful with how you address it. We know you dont want drugs and want pain control instead, but again, doctors arent mind readers. Maybe it would be better if they were, they'd realize how often theyre wrong about those trying to treat pain.Gabapentin and Pregablin are usually for treating nerve type pain.  So if you dont have nerve related stuff going on, I wouldnt expect either to be terribly helpful. Is it possible your doc doesnt really understand the type of pain you are having? Maybe go over it again with them?But if youre expecting them to know how youre doing without telling them, think again....best of luck...",

It's not easy to grow but you may very well have a good climate for it.Are kratom like substances allrwady illegal too? In some US states there are laws that anything that pops up in the future that hits opiode receptors falls under the same ban kratom did. Hopefully this is not how your laws are. I say this because there are a couple plants I have not looked into that work like kratom does but not as strong. There is somthing called wild lettus / opiate lettuce i have ready it is similar to kratom. There is 1 other i can look up.I know a LOT on kratom but I know nothing about these other plants all I know is they are a thing that could maybe help like kratom does. Sorry I'm not much help here I hate when kratom is made illegal kratom saved my life, it got me off street drugs and opiates as well.",

I mean it\u2019s ridiculous at one point I was on four Percocet and two morphine a day one day a Doctor Who doesn\u2019t even know me walks in the room and tells me that we have to wean me off of all of my meds when I started crying, she kept saying oh sweetie don\u2019t cry. This isn\u2019t your fault. She said no one should\u2019ve ever prescribed these meds for you in the first place so I was weaned off all of my meds in a matter of two months and it was pure hell! Then they put me on buprenorphine which made me gain 70 pounds in fluid and it\u2019s not the first time I have been on that type of medicine the same thing happened when I was on the Butrans patch and Lyrica. When I told my doctor she said well being overweight won\u2019t kill you.  So another doctor in that clinic took me off the buprenorphine finally and they wanted to put me on methadone not only did they put me on methadone, but they found it appropriate to rip me off of my Cymbalta, which I have been on for years because you cannot take the two together. The doctor that originally took my meds away told me well if the methadone doesn\u2019t work for you then I don\u2019t know what to tell you we don\u2019t have anything else that we can do to treat your pain. I went home hysterically sobbing I mean, can you believe that how inhumane Thank God I found a new doctor and she took over all of my medical care pain management Mental Health everything I am now back on my Percocet and my morphine and my Cymbalta. I\u2019ve been trying another rheumatoid arthritis medicine that seem to be helping some but in the last five weeks, I\u2019ve had three infections so I had to go off of it And it has also made me gain weight anyway I don\u2019t want to tell you my life story but I thought it was important to let you and other people here know you were not alone! The medical community is mistreating pain, patients, and something legally has to happen because people\u2018s quality of life is going downhill And it\u2019s inhumane quite honestly it is absolutely inhumane!

        "text": "This probably has more to do with you addressing the doctor about the inadequacy of your pain control regemin... just remember, when you move to a higher dose, you can also increase unwanted side effects. And it will cause tolerance even to the new dose eventually. The best way to address this is a periodic rotation between a couple different meds.  Like Norco for a few months, then percocet for a few months, then back to norco, etc etc. As long as its different from what the receptors are already saturated by, it should keep tolerance away. Watch that apap, you know the liver thing, Im sure. Dont take anything with more tylenol in it.",

I\u2019m saying this because I failed a DT for alcohol because of a funeral I went to where they served drinks afterwards and almost lost my pain meds, but you can drink without any ramifications. I just had 3 failed back surgeries in October and I can\u2019t get any relief from my meds, only when I\u2019m blackout drunk or higher than the pines. And I can\u2019t drink because of my contract.

Obviously you need to be taking them you to me don't seem to have any dependency upon them you just want to say out of pain and that is natural for any human being. I think that these doctors are starting to realize the impact on their patient's health that withholding these medications are taking and there are groups out there who like myself are fighting to try to make the world understand a little bit better about our pain patients and about opioid use disorder and what it really entails. The news the government all of them are to blame for this and eventually it will blow up in their face and I really hope that I am alive whenever that does happen because I would like to see these people brought to justice arrested and put in jail. Thank you for letting me say my peace and I'm so happy for you I am just over the moon for you and I encourage others if you have to resort to tears if you have to resort to any means possible to advocate for yourself use it or if you have someone who can advocate for you who is just got some brass v a l l s you need to bring them along to the appointments every single time.

I get why people get annoyed when I talk about my pain but they don't get that I only talk about it when it's so bad that I can't push through. I am constantly in pain and the reason why I don't constantly talk about it is that I am used to it and it doesn't change anything anyway. I had to take a whole day to myself yesterday because I wanted to see my loved ones for Christmas. Couldn't do anything but lay in bed all day. I hate it. And people don't seem to get it. And they get annoyed. So I lose people because I can't meet up and I have to cancel last minute and there is always something wrong with me. I am crying while typing this. I feel lonely and my pain is so bad today that I had to cancel my plans again. I have friends who are understanding, but they don't know. They don't know how it feels to be in pain all the time. They try to be there but I can tell, some of them are getting annoyed already. Maybe I'll have to find new friends soon. If I can. I don't know. I don't even know if I can do this much longer, honestly. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to let it all out and this is the only place I feel safe to talk about my pain.",

Since being trans and being on HRT is something most doctors have no familiarity with, they'll be quick to pin your pain on that because it's the easiest scapegoat in their mind. \"I don't know about this so it must be causing your pain.\" It's sick and twisted, and to be honest I'm surprised I haven't encountered this yet (I had my ovaries removed and am on HRT including a slightly higher dose of T, I present as a woman but internally I identify as NB, I often refer to myself as a woman on here for simplicity sake).If you feel comfortable, I highly suggest reporting both these doctors. What they said was way out of line. Even if you feel they weren't being explicitly transphobic, what they said is rooted in transphobia. There is literally zero scientific evidence to back up their claims. They just took something unique about you and blamed that. Like did they expect you to detransition or stop your gender-affirming care?? That's something you could mention to, that their negligent care made you feel like they wanted you to detransition. I know I'd feel like a doctor was questioning my identity if they tried to get me to stop T for no valid reason whatsoever.So sorry you experienced this OP. Being trans is hard enough, and running up against systemic discrimination sucks the big one.",

Vitamin C\u2019s positive effects in lowering proinflammatory cytokines lead to a reduction in the requirement for opiate analgesics, facilitating better healing and faster recovery, and mild adverse effects make it a promising adjuvant for managing postoperative recovery. Continued research efforts in this sector will provide a better understanding of the efficacy, safety, and appropriate application of vitamin C in orthopedic therapy, leading to improvements in patient care and outcomes.",

    "content": "Prior to my experience with this pain, I wouldn\u2019t say I was a positive person, but I never really complained much, I made decent money, didn\u2019t really have much of a social life but as an introvert, I loved just reading, watching documentaries, learning about different things from economics and history to physics and philosophy. I learnt to cook, and I felt very self-sufficient. I always feared the worst (in terms of losing my health or my ability) and I guess I was right to do so. I seem to have an apt for predicting the worst things in life. When I was 12, I\u2019d cry over the fear of losing my dad; and I was right about that too.Chronic pain has made me completely miserable and insanely angry, I still have to keep going in life but I am angry, I do hit myself from time to time. Yesterday as I was washing my dish, I felt my pain again, and I proceeded to smash my head really hard against the faucet, I did bleed for a bit and now I have a cut. My mom lives with me and today, she saw the cut and she said please for my sake, get therapy, I can\u2019t continue to live like this. And I\u2019m insanely angry with this too, because maybe a part of what I\u2019m experiencing is genetic (I do have degenerative discs in my early 30\u2019s and some doctors have told me this is genetic to some degree and I couldn\u2019t have helped it) and despite physio, injections and other interventions, none of it has helped. I keep thinking I resent my parents, because part of this probably has something to do with their genes. I\u2019m doing everything I can to help myself and I think I reserve the right to be angry for all of this. I have spoken to a therapist before and now I\u2019m being told to speak to someone else, because this person has a PhD and is specialized for people in pain. But I\u2019m so effing tired of throwing money at this and I\u2019m thinking what is she going to tell me that I don\u2019t already know? To embrace the pain? To learn to live with it? To accept it? To be more kind to myself? Yeah, thanks! None of that is a solution to pain, it\u2019s just coping with it and I\u2019m sorry but I want a solution not a tool that\u2019s going to distract me from the anger I feel because of pain. I also then got told, all that you do is earn money and pay the bills. Which isn\u2019t true, I cleaned my bathroom yesterday, I vacuumed the stairs and wiped down the windows the other weekend. I can\u2019t do as much as I used to because of the pain, but I do my best. I also get told that she does a lot for me and I do nothing in return. But it\u2019s like, I keep going because of her, I don\u2019t have any desire to continue with this existence otherwise.I get told there\u2019s a lot of negativity in me, and how it\u2019s manifesting itself as more pain. And talking to someone would help ease my pain. But there\u2019s a difference between not being a positive person and being a miserable mean spirited person. I\u2019m not an optimist because I find it delusional given how much misery there is in this world. I have completely lost my faith which was shaky already even before I had this experience, but now I\u2019m more convinced that we are just at the mercy of nature and it is a coin toss which end of the coin you end up getting. I don\u2019t think any of this makes me a \u201cnegative\u201d person. I think I\u2019m just a realist. Heck, i was seeing someone years ago while they were still hung over someone else, and we broke off, and they ended up marrying the person. While a lot of people would feel resentful after something like this, I wished them well and hoped they lived happily. In fact I even thought of that experience as one that opened my eyes to just how awesome being single was. If I was negative, I would\u2019ve cried about this and ruminated over how unfair all of this was. I chose to look at it with the most positive outlook possible. And to still be told I am negative is just puzzling to me. I\u2019m angry because of pain, if the pain left me one day, I would not be this way.Is therapy just going to offer me some more delusions to keep this shit going? Do anti-depressants even help? I\u2019m sorry I\u2019d rather just continue to be angry if that\u2019s the case. I sometimes feel better when I experience pain in other areas after I injure myself it eases the other pain I normally feel. Crying also helps a little.Anyway I\u2019m sorry for the rant. But I guess this has become my ranting space now. Hope all of you are doing better. Love to you all.",

        "text": "Yes I am very sick of it.  I relate to every thing you wrote and I am bothered by many of the responses here.  I have actually been in therapy for most of the last 20 years.  I have had numerous therapists of different qualities.  I am huge proponent of therapy but absolutely sick of being told it is a treatment for chronic illness.  You are correct that it doesn\u2019t change anything about living with chronic pain or disability.  I\u2019m sick of being told CBT or any psychological intervention is a treatment for chronic pain.  If they\u2019re going to make that as a sweeping generalization, I\u2019m going to say it\u2019s completely fallacious.If you have a nail in your foot, no amount of being told to focus on the positive, of practicing mindfulness, of laughing, of feeling heard, is truly going to change things in any order of magnitude comparable to actually removing the fucking nail.  The truth is there are thousands of ways to be unwell that are physically real, akin to a nail in your foot.  A lot of us aren\u2019t just dealing with emotional or stress-induced problems that could be mediated with influencing our thoughts and feelings.  We have physical problems akin to a nail in the foot.Someone else here said \u201coh people with chronic illness, even when they get better they just complain about the time wasted and still act miserable.\u201d Y\u2019all we need to stop doing this.  This is gaslighting ourselves, victim-shaming ourselves.  Chronic pain patients are NOT just a bunch of pathetic negative Nellie\u2019s looking for anything to be miserable about.  I was disabled before for five years and when I got better, I was so effing happy about it.  Yes life still contained other real hardships that had an impact on me.  But one thing I was perpetually thankful for? Not being disabled anymore.  I seized life by the ovaries.  I did incredible things, because I was now physically able to do them.  My greatest suffering really was caused by the physiological damage in my body and once that was taken away I bounced back 110% and became a vivacious, hopeful, confident, energetic, daring, positive person again.  Getting injured and being in chronic pain again has been devastating.  But i know exactly how much of my \u201cmisery\u201d and pessimism and anger is caused by my physical reality and it\u2019s ALL OF IT.  Despite going through other hardship and loss in life, I have done the work the process and integrate it, I have done the work on myself and it\u2019s clear to me my only real problem is the visceral reality of severe constant pain.All this other noise seeking to imply chronic illness and pain patients just need to manage stress or go to therapy is victim-blaming.  It\u2019s all rooted in the \u201cbelief in a just world\u201d fallacy that makes more abled people feel safe that something like this will never happen to them.If you haven\u2019t ever gone to therapy you should try it.  I know it\u2019s good for me to have a dedicated time every week to vent about my life.  I know it\u2019s good to have someone who feels like she cares about me and believes me and won\u2019t make me listen to her talk about triggering things in her life just because I\u2019ve reached out to talk about mine.  It\u2019s good to have someone who won\u2019t gaslight me and will just accept what I say is true.  It\u2019s good to have someone tell I\u2019m strong and brave because I often feel so shitty about myself due to what my disability has done to my life and dreams.  It\u2019s good to have someone validate the crazy things that happen in my personal life and fighting the medical system, a witness so to speak.  I benefit emotionally and mentally from therapy but that has not helped or changed the physical ramifications of my illness at all.   It is totally invalidating to what I\u2019m living with when people imply the normal response to this nightmare life is something that can be mitigated by talking to a nice person about it once a week.  I both wholly support anyone going to therapy and am glad I have done it myself, while agreeing that it can\u2019t actually perform a meaningful effect in the reality of life for some kinds of disability and pain.",

        "text": "Sorry to laugh a little, but I wish I had a nickel for everyone who said the psychological affects of pain would disappear with the physical pain. Its wishful thinking. If your pain was gone tomorrow, you'd be pissed off about wasted time. Take a look through the archived posts, youll see plenty of folks that thought the same thing about pain as you do, they got their medical problem resolved and they were still miserable...You need to stop pretending anger is normal. Talk to your doc cause you sure dont know much about the nervous system and how it works. Do you have high inflammation markers on your blood tests? Its actually a measure of adrenaline. Thats not good for trying to relax, but its how a body reacts to stress, by making chemical adjustments.I cant think of something more physical, even if it doesnt begin as physical. The mind affects the body and vice versa. Its not just a line from \"the Matrix\".This articlemay explain the connection a little better, but everything, from anger to depression and yes even pain, depends on chemical changes in the brain and spinal fluid. Its actually a pretty interesting article, if you have a few minutes. You may recognize some of the chemical issues of emotion and mood that make pain worse. Im sure your very relaxed, being angry at everyone and everything.  Sounds pretty miserable. Get some therapy...",

I thought fuck that, I don't need to accept my pain, I need it to be gone, I have every right to be angry about being in pain.But at the end of the day how was that anger serving me? What good was it bringing to my life? Absolutely none. And it was affecting those around me too. So not only was I miserable and in pain, I was making others miserable too, and that's not fair.Therapy only really helps if it's with someone specialising in chronic pain/illness. They know what it's like and they know proven ways to help. Oh, it doesn't make the physical pain go away. But it helps to function in spite of it.",

        "text": "I\u2019ve read that self injury is a way (but not the best) to stimulate endogenous pain relief.So maybe people with a lot of pain are more prone to that type of not intentionally wanting to hurt themselves but hurting to help kind of stuff. Even if it looks backwards as hell from a third person perspective.I\u2019m gonna keep promoting craniosacral therapyMaybe I should just open anr/ChronicPainclinic.It\u2019s not gonna be covered by insurance but it\u2019s also not the psychiatry-psychology complex.I have full on bias because I have had limited anything with \u201ctherapy.\u201d I even worked in inpatient \u201ctherapy.\u201dThat grand experience was both incredibly upsetting and enlightening.At one point in time, I pretty much talked in CBT language all the time. That was not helpful. I\u2019ve even read a study where adolescents/teens became worse off with CBT intervention.One psychology appointment for biofeedback for anxiety helped me oodles. I only had to go to one appointment and I got benefits for\u2026 years. That\u2019s how I learned about how\u2026 if you breathe a certain way\u2026 you literally cannot panic or be anxious.But it\u2019s personalized to you because they try different intervals of inhale-hold-exhale-hold while measuring heart rate, respiration rate, and finger temperatures.That was the best experience in psychology I have ever had.Any time I tried to go to \u201ctherapy\u201d and got a social worker therapist \u2026 it was honestly  kind of a waste of time for me.But you know what. I still have pain. I still have joint issues. I really wish I could get pain medicine like I did when I was younger.Breathing alone has not allowed me to be successful in school or work like I used to be.I feel like I was cut off from success. I\u2019ve been abandoned by family over the consequences of under and unemployment because they thought I wasn\u2019t trying hard enough.So I had to reframe a lot of things.Because I am amazing.And I am valuable.The rules of this society aren\u2019t the rules of life.\u2026 that\u2019s where I fade out because the rest of it is spiritual talk.",

        "text": "Chronic Back Pain is Associated with Decreased Prefrontal  and Thalamic Gray Matter DensitiesWhat does the regional pattern of atrophy imply? The observed regional pattern of atrophy is distinct from that seen in chronic depression or anxiety (Bell-McGinty et al., 2002; Almeida et al., 2003; Yamasue et al., 2003) and shows a minimal relationship with anxiety and depression traits. Thus, it seems to be specific to chronic pain, especially because the regions showing atrophy, the thalamus and DLPFC, participate in pain perception. The DLPFC is activated in acute pain, with responses that do not code stimulus intensity (Coghill et al., 1999).",

        "text": "Well, I definitely felt like I wrote this. For over a decade I have had chronic pain starting at 23.  After my wife and doctors pleaded with me to start therapy. About 6 months ago I did. It was awful for about 3 months meeting weekly. I didn\u2019t want to let go of the anger. I felt like it was the only thing keeping me going. That wasn\u2019t true for me. My therapist kept working with me.She asked what I wanted in life. My answer pain free and happiness.  She walked me through about how my anger, anxiety and stubbornness were getting in my way. Eventually I asked to meet twice a week. Around the same time my best friend was starting to lose weight and be more active. We always talked about backing on the north shore. His encouragements I started to diet and lose weight (doctors for years told me losing weight would help my chronic pain).Combing therapy, diet/exercise, and trying to be positive. I am happier, my body is feeling better, my chronic pain feels more manageable.  The truth though is you have to be ready for it. In my opinion if you aren\u2019t ready it won\u2019t work.  I am fortunate to have a supportive network from doctors, family and friends. My biggest regret is not doing it sooner.My chronic pain is still here and doctors have told me it won\u2019t go away but it can be lessen with weight loss. They are right. My chronic pain is in my low back and hips. I knew it was working when I slipped on wet stone and my core engaged and my back had support. It was a massive win for me. Prior to that I would have been in bed for at least a day nursing my back to its normal level.The part about resenting your parents. I get it my mom and I have very similar issues. To the point I am going child free because I don\u2019t want to pass it on. I blamed them for all my issues. My siblings don\u2019t have any chronic pain. What I have found is I get a ton of support and advice from her. We get together every couple of weeks and talk about the good and bad around our issues. We get ideas from each other.I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s all rainbows and cupcakes now. There\u2019s still bad days but less. My journey may not apply to you, but I wanted to share because I feel like I could have wrote this post myself not too long ago.  Too anyone reading this you are stronger than you know. One minute at a time can build to days then weeks. Don\u2019t give up. You got this.",

I know for me, having normal therapists (due to my insurance, I don\u2019t really have a choice in who I see) can be frustrating at times.I\u2019m sorry about your lot in life. Having chronic pain is hard. Being in pain every day is literal torture. Even killers let their victims have breaks from pain and finish them off. For us, there are never breaks, and we are expected to continue going on as though nothing is wrong. It\u2019s so hard and difficult. I cannot blame your anger.But honestly, I do think therapy might help. Because so long as you\u2019re living, you need an ally. And I\u2019m not talking the therapist being your ally; I\u2019m talking about YOU being your ally.It sounds like you are incredibly harsh and unforgiving to yourself, even if not directly. That incident with the sink; the pain that occurred wasn\u2019t your fault. And yet, you punished your body for it by inflicting an injury out of anger.You absolutely need kindness, and patience from yourself. If not for your body\u2019s sake, for your mind\u2019s sake. You are trapped in a prison you don\u2019t have a lot of control over.I know what it\u2019s like to want to blame something. Be it ourselves, family or society, or some or all of the above. But if you are going to move forward in living life, you simply cannot treat your body as your enemy. There needs to be self-love here, patience and kindness.If a child came up to you and cried that they were in pain, you likely wouldn\u2019t hit them and blame them for being in pain, right? Maybe you\u2019d sympathize or want to hug them or reassure them. You deserve all of that too, especially from yourself.That\u2019s just my opinion though.

It's not cuz there's anything wrong with us it's to deal with the other people that are making us feel insignificant blamed and I could go on but I won't. I'm a ex therapist. There's nothing wrong with us except that we are unfortunate enough to have diseases that are related to chronic pain that's all that's all we've done. Now some of us might have trauma that's not related to The chronic pain. But if people are telling you to go to a therapist just cuz you have chronic pain they're probably thinking there's something wrong with you. Few times they ever get referred clients because they came in and said I'm being bullied by my doctor my family in the world told I should just lose weight I wish I would have got clients like that because they would have been knowledgeable mentally healthy and only needed therapy to deal with the people that make our lives worse. You're not mentally ill because you have chronic pain I've got the degrees in the years of school to prove that. But I tell you what the people that we deal with there should be a class on how chronic pain people deal with society and the people around us cuz that's what we really need. How often have you been sitting there crying and somebody comes up and says oh you just need to stop giving into the pain or oh you just need to like run 50 miles a day when you don't have a spine anymore. We need to know how to deal with people like that sometimes a therapist can tell you how to deal with that sometimes they can't. But there's nothing wrong with the majority of us that have chronic pain and when I say that I mean nothing mentally except we're probably bullied and made to feel like where the cause of it and we're not. Thank you for listening to me I know I run on and on but I'm sorry. This makes me very angry because even though I was a therapist in front of pain I got told the same thing.",

For sure part of having a more peaceful existence is to actually acknowledge that a lot of advice won\u2019t apply to you at the same scale, you can\u2019t measure achievements the same or see your life through the lens of your old life. If you find therapy doesn\u2019t help , you don\u2019t have to do it , do something else that will help. Massage therapy , acupuncture , somatic therapy , acupuncture , EMDR, physio , psychedelics, meditation , all different modalities that can help in one way or another. A lot of times it isn\u2019t mind over matter .. the body needs to be calmed down and then the mind will follow. Some therapists are also utterly shite people and therapists or okay therapists but not for you it can take a while to find one you like or not , it\u2019s totally up to you. You can be stuck in a story especially strongly if you\u2019re in pain a lot and it\u2019s good to have a neutral party to offer a different perspective.",

        "text": "Lol try posting this on one of the normal Reddit subs, I got torn to pieces on there for moaning about my ex saying I needed therapy (ironically, he just needed a better therapist).My mental health around chronic pain actually started to improve when my pain was better managed, and more recently by me having to manage it on my own, so starting to feel more independent and connected with my body again (bar the nicotine addiction I took up post breakup). At my lowest I tried to use a needle on my hand, but I was in the middle of a 2 week flare, just dumped, 3 hours sleep and was struggling to walk, but had to, because my transport help was gone lol. Then I was like shit that hurts and was in more pain and never did it again.I would say if you're bashing your head on sink level it may still be worth considering some type of mental health support, because head injuries can be potentially fatal if you hit hard enough.I also hate how people bang on about therapy. I had to do it for several years because I grew up with abusive parents. It's really not fun and it's not an immediate fix all for everything. These are the type of people that go to therapy because they're lonely, and then don't feel lonely because they now have someone to talk too, because likely their friends don't want to speak to them about their surface level life problems, and then they tell people suffering in daily agony to get therapy because it really helped them get over that situationship they met like 3 times and develop coping strategies like mindfulness to cure their inner mind. Maybe I should try it for a nerve injury.I will say there is defo a mental link with me for chronic pain (I posted about it today actually), but not that I'm not in pain, but if I feel like I can manage it and do some things I enjoy, it doesn't feel as awful? I didn't need to go to therapy to learn that doing things I enjoy and cooking for myself again and not having to constantly feel guilty about being in pain (because I just get to chill at home on my pain meds now and watch my favourite shows lol or read my book) would improve my mental health.",

When it happened everyone was like, yup, it was just a matter of time till something like this happened.  Shortly afterward they heard the public outcry and revamped the entire program because they saw how unjust it was.  They admitted decades of wrongdoing and unfairly denying claims and having doctors that would automatically deny the patients but they wouldn\u2019t admit that their practices were the cause of the gunman\u2019s motivation.

This execution (that's what it was) happened basically right in front of the main entrance to the Hilton. That is an 1800 room hotel - one of the largest, if not THE largest hotel in the city. Hotels like that have tons of employees, especially during a shift change (Front Desk & other Operations Departments). Front line employees typically run 3 shifts: 7am-3pm, 3-11, & 11-7. There would be LOTS of people coming onto shift & leaving their shifts. Where were the bellmen? They would normally have at least 2 outside during this time, helping guests with luggage,  cabs, etc. I don't see them in any pics or videos of the attack.",

Personal health issues with denials, a loved one dying because of denials, a hit because of any of the above or a business deal gone awry, heck, could even be a domestic dispute (ie maybe he slept with someone\u2019s wife.)We can only guess at this point. What we do know is he was pretty calm and collected, so has some experience, appeared to plan it out and know where and how to get away without getting caught, and somehow had somewhat-ish inside info knowing where he would be and when. According to ex-fbi, he said he doesn\u2019t think a hit man since it would be rare for one to do it out in public and they usually apparently do it after watching their days and finding the best time during his daily routine. This outing wouldn\u2019t have been routine. He did however say that silencers are available but rare and harder to get, and that this guy knew to use one at that time to not cause attention where if it were later in the day, experienced shooters wouldn\u2019t want a silencer so onlookers would be scared and duck, thus not be able to identify.I learned more today than I thought I ever needed. Kinda interesting. In the meantime the only people in this whole thing I feel sorry for are his kids. Otherwise, I just wonder if he\u2019s done or if he has a list.",

His very next question was regarding my epilepsy, he asked how I managed it, if i took any medications to manage it, to which I replied \u201cyes, clonazepam, but since you have told me I don\u2019t need it, I guess I don\u2019t need it, my neurologist will be pleased, especially since my previous medication commonly causes renal stones and other issues, and you asked me to get it changed to an alternative by my neurologist. I have however gone over 18 months without a seizure, if I have a seizure during this admission as a result of not receiving the appropriate medication, it means that my driving license will be suspended again for at least 12 months, resulting in quite a large loss of income as I\u2019ll no longer be able to get to work, I\u2019ll be contacting my solicitor to discuss options in regards too loss of earnings, physical and mental pain and suffering, and whatever else he thinks is appropriate\u201dThe look on his face was a picture, one of pure shock and disbelief. Safe to say all of my regular meds were prescribed and given as normal, and my reasonable requests were all granted without argument surprisingly \ud83d\ude05It\u2019s disgusting that things had to get to that point, and what\u2019s worse is probably the vast amount of patients who don\u2019t have as much experience as those of us with chronic illnesses, would have Just accepted what he said without question, as we are taught from a young age to trust drs, to trust their opinions, trust that they know exactly what they\u2019re doing, and so on.Sadly we need to start teaching people to be their own advocates, to question what we\u2019re being told, until we get an answer that\u2019s explained to the point where we fully understand what\u2019s going on, not to agree to things blindly, so that informed consent means just that! So drs are held accountable, and don\u2019t rely on blind trust, and when things go wrong, can\u2019t get away with just saying something like \u201ccomplications happen, it\u2019s just one of those things\u201d",

It's just so obviously touchy and some of these folks just don't even think about it.I totally get the idea of wanting to address the underlying issues but one must consider that there could be hard, or even impossible, to explain conditions that could cause these things. Some people have high or low BP because of genetics.In my case, I have chronic flank and back pain. The kidney stones I can only fight off by avoiding oxalate and drinking a metric fk ton of water daily. The back pain is operable but due to a few weird factors involved with my herniated disc it would very likely cause more harm than good. In other words, I'm stuck.I'm glad you kicked this one to the curb.

        "text": "All drugs have some degree of physical dependence, particulary if the drug is effective. Youre always going to have a degree of medication withdrawal, but it can be moderated with a slow tapering of dose while addressing/supporting the symptoms. Dont worry about getting off the drug before youre on it. Amitriptyline should be easy to stop, if it doesnt work for you.  Hopefully that wont be the case. Amitriptyline is a good drug for this sort of thing, relaxation and sedation can be helpful with pain. The opposite of tension is relaxation. Im speaking in the physical sense, like with tense muscles.10mg is a rather small dose, I know at one point I was taking around 300mg. Now I have a bottle of 75mg tablets that I break in to quarters if I have sleep trouble. Its old amitriptyline, but it works. How's your doc Rxing this? If its once a day, its a perfect med for bedtime. You shouldnt have too much of a \"hangover\" once you get some morning caffeine in you, anyhow.Please dont make the mistake of relying on what people say on line. Not everyone with an opinion is an actual pain patient, and if they are, what youre dealing with could be a completely different issue. You gotta try this drug to see what it will do. Only then can you know how its going to affect you. Every body is different enough that it makes trying to predict the effects of a treatment extremely difficult.One thing I would do, before you start this drug, is check on line and see if there are any drug interactions you need to be aware of. Lots of on line checkers, and they do miss interactions sometimes when prescribing or filling the Rx. You might come up with some pretty scary warnings, but thats how its worded for patients, to scare them out of doing something dumb with medication. So take the warnings with a grain of salt too. Your doc is probably aware of any possible interactions with your medication regemin, its always a calculation of risk vs benefit. But you should know what symptoms a drug interaction might cause, so if your heart starts pounding in your chest, you know why. That sort of thing. Its much better for medication anxiety if you know what sort of symptoms might occur.I didnt have any trouble stopping Amitriptyline when I felt I wanted to.  As I mentioned, I stopped in mid Rx which is how I now have enough in the bottle to outlast me, at the rate things are going. But I dont want anyone else thinking they wont have issues, based on  my experience. You never know, every body is different.As far as the anti-depressant effects, it beats me. I never felt particularly depressed (lost is a different matter) so I cant really say if it helped with that or not. I was on Paroxitine (Paxil) for a while, which is a totally different kind of A-D drug, which I also quit cold (something I dont suggest) and with that drug, I did notice the anti depressant effect. These depression drugs are all very subtle in their results. I didnt realize the Paxil had done anything until I stopped taking it. I felt better on the Paxil, shit didnt bother me as much. And it was over a casual sexual relationship that went south, so nothing of real life consequence, which made it easier to get past. The sooner youre out of a bad relationship, the sooner you can look for a better one.Have you ever tried a TENS unit on this? Its not really what the device is intended to do, but it should also give your occipitales  neck and upper back a bit of an electrical massage. A TENS is really supposed to work on the nerves, the massage thing is sort of a side benefit. They do make dedicated muscle stimulators  where the \"pull\"  is stronger, but they can get real expensive. There's a nice little TENS kit on Amazon for about $40, if youre interested. My TENS has seen better days, it would take a while to get all the parts assembled in one spot...Anyhow, I dont think you have anything to worry about, give The Amitriptyline a try. Then you will know how it affects you. Who cares how it affects somebody else?  Still it wouldnt hurt if you could sleep in the next day, just in case. 10mg is kind of a light dose, but it should be pretty good for relaxing your muscles and getting better sleep. If its not, tell your doc. To be honest, I cant recall if it takes awhile for Amitriptyline to build up in your system, these sorts of drugs usually do. So give it at least a month, unless you encounter some unbearable side effects where you should call right away. Best of luck, I hope it helps....",

If they dont fall off, they do what theyre doing to your skin. Theres probably not much you can do about it any lotion you put on will just make the next patch slippery. Itll heal and itch like mad, but you need a different route of administration, like a pill unless swallowing is problematic, if so you can probably do with a liquid medication.

If the skin is affected the same way, it\u2019s contact dermatitis.Not exactly an allergy, just the way some people\u2019s skin reacts and breaks down under the bandage. It\u2019s good to know for injuries and, well, I guess medication patches.If there are shorter term patches (I seem to remember a 3 day fent patch) you may be able to use those, otherwise you\u2019ll likely want to switch to oral again.Take this with a grain of salt.

I had patch scars for a while on my arms, chest and back. He put me back on oral medication.Edit: I took pictures and took the old patches into my appt to show him.

If I've used alcohol on the area where I'll be placing the adhesive and forget to thoroughly rinse the area, the skin irritation is worse and happens more quickly.For reference, I have many tattoos and compulsively pick at my skin, so I've used a variety of adhesive tapes and bandages. With tattoos, it's common for the artist to use alcohol or green soap (which contains alcohol) while working. If the artist is more old-school and covers the finished tattoo in plastic wrap, you don't have to worry about it, but artists who use adhesive barrier films (e.g. Tegaderm or Saniderm) have to be extra careful to completely wipe down the area with water (or witch hazel) before applying the film to reduce the chances of the client having a reaction to it.",

        "text": "Most medical research, until quite recently was based upon male bodies. Researchers didn't want to deal with women's fluctuating hormones. So a lot of assumptions have been made. Sexism dictates that women must be weaker and less than men. Hell at one point women were barred from sports like marathons. Add to it that boys are taught to be stoic (unless they're angry,,). Displays of emotions (other than happy and angry) are seen as \"weak\" and \"womanly\". Women get trapped. If we tear up we're being \"emotional\" and dismissed. If we are stoic and/or dissociated from our pain, it must not be that bad.These things are no longer explicitly taught in medical school. But during internship, residency and fellowship these attitudes are shared and taught in word & example.What really gets me is when female doctors gave the same attitudes. Ugh.There's a post on another sub yesterday. A couple are both sick. The woman started first and has been dx with bronchitis and has asthma. The husband has a bad cough. Even after X-rays were done the woman was refused stronger cough meds and/or steroids. Her husband didn't even ask and got the codeine and steroids. This was without any X-rays. It's infuriating.",

        "text": "It's not only with pain management. There has been a very long term bias in the medical community that women are just being hysterical when presenting a complaint. If you look back around 1900, a Hysterectomy was a common 'cure' for everything from depression to cancer and was a standard practice in asylums. There was an entire branch of medicine devoted to treating 'female hysteria' with 'Pelvic Massage' during which the Doctor would stimulate the woman until she had an orgasm. (This led to the invention of the steam powered vibrator) In recent history, the usual treatment for any complaint has been to prescribe an antidepressant. The medical community kills quite a few women every year doing this.",

        "text": "What is wild to me is that men are known to not like to go to doctors but women tend to ignore their pain often. We are caregivers and usually put others before us, and sometimes that means we ignore our symptoms. I've known something was wrong, but didn't want to go in.I feel like I've got the opposite experience for the most part. When I was younger, yes, it was more like that for me. In fact, I had a male OB who delivered my twins in 2009, when 3 weeks later I was in the ER with gallbladder disease. I had to prep for surgery even though they wanted to do emergency surgery, so about 3 weeks after that, I was in outpatient surgery to remove the gallbladder. My OB at the time did laproscopic surgery to see the condition of my uterus (severe menstrual issues and heavy bleeding). I woke up from that surgery to my OB telling me that I had severe endometriosis and my uterus had adhered to my bowels and abdominal wall. He suggested a hysterectomy. I was 22 and knew I wanted to have more babies so I told him that, right there on the recovery bed. He said so bluntly \"that's okay, go get pregnant, I'll deliver the baby and remove the uterus right there\" LIKE BOY I JUST GAVE BIRTH TO TWINS!!!!!!! His cut and dry, disconnect from reality or whatever it was rubbed me so wrong. I left him and found the most amazing female ob/gyn ever.But, I think my advocating skills have improved and have helped me get taken more seriously. I've done massive research on things, I've even started medical school. The doctors don't know what to think when a patient comes in with knowledge like I do. They can't fuck around and lie about things.Overall though, this is so true and makes 0 sense. It's funny how women have been made to look like delicate creatures over time but truthfully, they are the stronger sex in so many ways. I'm sorry. It's true.",

Her scale was for people to put in order what hurts more and she found consistently that men were judging women's pain like childbirth somewhere along the lines of a sprained ankleQuestion about the channel, it looks like a hippy granola aesthetic, so why \"warrior\"?",

I went from dr to dr specifically 5 drs in a month before I got to the point where I was so sick I was admitted after 15 mins to ICU. Dr couldn\u2019t find anything he did scans, mri, ct, ultrasound s, x ray everything. He tried to say nothing was wrong. My mom asked him to try a lap surgery on me. He said he didn\u2019t want to because of some lame excuse. I asked for second opinion and that I wasn\u2019t going to leave because now the pain is worse. I get new team of drs she requested one test and basically then asked for a new x ray and they say that j needed surgery now. So they did surgery and had to convert to open because of the damage on my intestines. My intestines had ruptured opens basically bursted open. And they had to be repaired in 4 places. 4 holes where they bursted open. Anyway I almost didn\u2019t make it but I did. I needed blood transfusions and all had sepsis and peritonitis and other stuff. Bottom line my life is different now. I have been diagnosed with so many new stuff because of it. And needed 7 open surgeries on my abdomen since. So yes I wish more people would listen to women. Btw my misdiagnosed didn\u2019t stop there. I\u2019m not gonna get into all of what happened. So definitely gonna check out this. Thanks!",

        "text": "Almost died from appendicitis as a teenager. My old, white, male doctor told me it couldn't be appendicitis because I wouldn't be able to walk or talk if the pain really was that bad. He said it must just be so.e cramping from my period. When I corrected him and said my period already came and went this month, he chided me and said \"well, it must be your ovulation then.\" He also made sure to call home and tell my Dad the same line- that I was suffering from female pains and it would subside on its own in about a week.Several days of increasingly worse pain later, I could barely crawl to the phone at school to beg my Mom to come and pick me up. I mentally prepared myself to die, because I was certain I had some kind of cancer of the ovaries or uterus for my ovulation pain to be this horrible and this persistent. I still believed that doctor, and also wondered if every woman went through this when they ovulated and I was super worried that maybe I was just really weak and pathetic.I needed emergency surgery late that night, and the ER doc said my appendix was not only wellllll past emergency removal time, it was swollen to 3 times its size and all wound up in a mass of my intestines. They had to pull out all of my lower intestines before they could attempt removing it, and the surgeon looked spooked when he said it burst in his hands just after removal. He was glad he had pulled it away from my open surgical cavity and wad of exposed intestines just in time to keep it from leaking infection everywhere. I remember my Mom and I sharing a frustrated look when he commented that I must have been having horrible pain for weeks!Unfortunately my story of being ignored and belittled by medical professionals only started there. I have a deep, deep mistrust that wavers into paranoia when it comes to doctors in general.",

        "text": "I am on my 4th pain specialist and I\u2019ve finally found a great doctor that is trying to get me diagnosed for what she believes is Lupus. My pcp and multiple ER trips were writing it off as constipation. Do I have constipation YES, is it causing all of my other symptoms NO.My bloodwork clearly shows kidney failure and what looks like Lupus. Did the male rheumatologist or my male pcp tell me this\u2026NO. They chose to ignore it (even tho the rheumatologist put in his notes that he believes I have Lupus and stage 3 chronic kidney failure).I also have endometriosis. I had ovary torsion and a 3.5 inch endometrioma and it was all fused to my colon. I waited almost 3 months for surgery and my ovary was dead from blood supply being cut off. The male surgeon told my husband afterwards \u201cHmm I would\u2019ve thought she would\u2019ve been in a lot of pain\u201d\u2026my husband said she was, that\u2019s why she broke down and went to the ER\u2026.. BUT it was misdiagnosed by ct scan and ultrasound, they thought I \u201cjust\u201d had a massive cyst on my ovary and put my surgery on the back burner because I had to wait until the surgeon got back from vacation and despite the fact that I told my pcp how bad the pain was, but I wasn\u2019t screaming and crying on the floor, so\u2026.yeah. Also\u2026prior to that, I\u2019ve had 10 surgeries for endometriosis and had lost all of my reproductive organs (except that left ovary), I said multiple times that the endometriosis was back and causing issues because after 30 years of this BS, I know my body and what endo feels like. AND after all of my reproductive organs were gone, I knew it had to have returned but I had multiple doctors telling me it wasn\u2019t possible without ovaries (two were at teaching facilities and treated me horribly, both were women and both had students with them), had surgery and endo was back with a vengeance.Fell down the stairs, had to have surgery on my shoulder for torn rotator cuff/tendon, bone spurs etc\u2026 the physical therapist screwed it up, had surgery again, PT screwed it up again. So I had a third surgery and did my own PT at home. The physical therapist had noted in my records that I have \u201czero pain tolerance\u201d\u2026 while they were f-ing up my tendon during therapy (torn worse than it was in the first place\u2026 bad enough that they ripped out the anchor that was placed in bone to hold the tendon in place).These are just a FEW of my horrible experiences.Edited to add: after I fell down the stairs, I had a pain specialist, pcp and PT telling me they didn\u2019t think anything was wrong because if anything was torn \u201cyour range of motion wouldn\u2019t be possible\u201d. \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2fAlso adding: the 3rd \u201cpain specialist\u201d was all about making me seem like a drug seeker SO, my pcp jumped on that wagon when he couldn\u2019t figure out wtf is going on with me. I am SO SO very glad my current pain specialist is kind, caring, very smart and doesn\u2019t believe that sh!t because of my symptoms and well she\u2019s ACTUALLY A GOOD DOCTOR. She\u2019s angry and very annoyed at the previous doctors and doesn\u2019t understand why they haven\u2019t done more for me (controlling pain, looking for a diagnosis, running more tests, taking biopsies etc)",

My wife suffers from chronic pain and we are both doctors, I\u2019m a board certified emergency physician.When it comes to heart attacks, the \u201cclassic\u201d presentation doesn\u2019t happen in women as often for a variety of reasons. They sometimes present late (and maybe this is a reflection of medicine not taking their pain seriously). They often have a slow narrowing of vessels and not a rapid obstruction. It makes it more challenging to diagnose. This isn\u2019t a valid excuse, I think we need to be better.Chronic pain in general, the ER is bad it managing this full stop. Good for acute presentations for sure. As you all know, managing chronic pain is extremely complex and challenging at the best of times and giving more drugs (often opiates) doesn\u2019t work long term. It sensitises nerve endings and it\u2019s simply prolonging the inevitable.With respect to managing women with chronic pain, a lot of this is pelvic pain due to several mechanisms but endometriosis is a major culprit. Men have different anatomy and theirs doesn\u2019t cause issues so you immediately have more women presenting with undiagnosed abdominal pain and chronic pain which we don\u2019t have an answer for. We don\u2019t have a test for this.  We don\u2019t have good treatment either.I\u2019m not giving the doctors a pass here. Chronic pain is real, it\u2019s debilitating and life altering. On the flip side, we have been very loose with opiates for a long time which has brought its own problems. We don\u2019t have a good way to diagnose a lot of these chronic conditions, we don\u2019t have medication to fix it either. It\u2019s very deflating as a doctor. It means we often send people home unsatisfied because we don\u2019t have a solution.If we do prescribe opiates, there is pain relief but the nerves become sensitised. You\u2019ll need more meds later or higher doses in the medium term. They cause constipation which adds to pelvic and abdominal pain. They make you drowsy. The list goes on.I think most of us genuinely care, but we just don\u2019t know how to help. These presentations are frustrating for all parties. The things that appear to help can ultimately cause more harm.I\u2019m sorry you are all going through this. The challenges to you and your loved ones are immense. I\u2019m sorry the medical profession in general struggles to help when you need it.",

    "content": "I went to the rheumatologist last December 3 for our second appointment. On our first appointment he checked my joints and he just muttered \"you're very hypermobile\" and I thought that'd just be it, but no! He sent lab tests (which all came out clear) and said it was something mechanic, so he gave me 1g of paracetamol when the pain is mild and naproxen 500 for when it's wild. I feel like the dosage needs to be adjusted since the paracetamol didn't do much.The very good thing is that my hospital provides all my medicine, so I left the hospital with a huge bag lol",

        "text": "Keep in mind both paracetamol and naproxen are the same sort of drug, non-steroid-anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs for short. So they are treating inflammation, which is usually okay, since you usually find inflammation where you find pain. Not always but usually, any kind of tissue, bone to nerve, can get irritated and inflamed. Its shouldnt kill ya.But they can do some harm. NSAIDs love to put holes in your GI system, (ulcers). So if you notice stuff like acid reflux, heartburn or stomach pain, talk to your doc right away. Double fast if you notice unusual blood in stool or vomit. Those \"cheese wedge\" pillows can keep you propped up enough to keep your stomach acid in your stomach, where it belongs. If your doc cut you loose with a bag of samples and no further instructions...its disappointing. So if you get stomach issues and theyre not responsive, get an OTC. Your pharmacist should be able to help, but you want something like Prevacid, Prilosec, one of those sorts of acid relievers. Generic cheap should be fine.And it goes without saying, do not exceed the directed dose. The dose may change, but you dont do it. Not till you talk to your doc. Thats the safest way to handle any medication. These drugs may be available without a Rx, but that doesnt mean theyre safe.The max safe limit of paracetamol is 4 grams a day. Less is better. Naproxen has a limit of 1500mg daily. So if youre getting close to either, its time to talk to your doctor. And if you dont find either terribly effective, there's probably more to your pain than just inflammation.There is a set of hypermobile/hyperflexible called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. Theres 13 different variants of hEDS, so a lot of things can fit, but they all include some sort of hyper flexibility. If you have other stuff going on that seems like a weird disconnected fit, maybe one of the variants might explain other symptoms.Being the 2nd appointment, its a little early for any sort of definitive diagnosis. They treat inflammation which is usually harmless if theyre wrong, and if you improve, the problem was inflammation. If the inflammation keeps getting better and coming back, there might be something mechanical irritating tissues. That could be a matter for a different doc, like an orthopedist, rather than a rheumatologist. There is a lot of \"process of elimination\" in medicine, it takes some patience to be a patient. Hang in there, hope those meds help...",

As we are trying to show, doctors discriminate against \"pain patients\" from the word go, anyways. It gets even worse when they start breaking the \"pain patient\" group down into smaller ones.Women, young americans, people of color, women of color, men of color, ect. It seems there is no end. They even do so to women when their lives are in danger. All of this must be reformed, we must demand change from our medical, social, and political leaders. We can't keep letting this continue.",

Giving birth is another thing. You go to a dentist and get local anesthesia for simple drilling but you're supposed to pretend that giving birth is so natural you just need to suffer through it. I had a section and four other surgeries, three of which were relatively minor compared to CS but it was having my abdomen, muscles underneath and the uterus sliced open when I was given a newborn afterwards and had to take care of her instead of focusing on recovery. Unfortunately, CS and subsequent hernia contributed to yet another  spot on the complex map of chronic pain all over my body too.You complain of problems and pains? You're hysterical or simply a poor overworked mother. How about you have another baby? The pain maybe just a bit heavier mensturational cycle. Or oncoming menopause. Or menopause. You should go part time or how about you give up your job and focus on home?\"Women are known to abuse painkillers. We should be careful.\" \"Here, take these antidepressants if you feel like you're in pain, you could be just depressed. They make you feel like a zombie and the pain is still there? Try another one for your migraines and other pains.\" \"Could you be just a little bit hysterical?\" \"It's all in your head.\" \"You're just oversensitive to little pain, that's it.\" \"You are observing yourself too much.\"The list is endless.I'm not on any pain medication and try to go without - I saw my father being addicted to opiates and I never want to be that zombie with an empty absent look who people didn't want to sit beside on a bus. He recovered but is addicted again, from what I've heard because I'm NC with him.

        "text": "I am a 23 year old woman and have spent about 90% of my life in the past 5 years in bed praying that God would just let me die already bc of debilitating pain. One of the biggest excuses I hear from doctors for not providing proper pain management or medical treatment is that I\u2019m \u201ctoo young\u201d. This argument will never make sense to me bc what\u2019s the point if I\u2019m wasting my youth bed ridden? I have EDS and type 1 diabetes (very brittle) which have caused severe gastroparesis and intestinal dismotility (among other things) and I finally started TPN over a year ago after years of failed treatments/procedures/tube feeds. I also finally got into palliative after multiple PCP doctors REFUSED to give me a referral to palliative bc I\u2019m \u201ctoo young\u201d even tho palliative is just comfort care in the US, which is completely different than hospice here which is end of life care. I am still having lots of tension between my doctors and I about continuing my current medical/pain regimen of TPN/IV meds at home and oxy even tho it\u2019s working very well for me and I am compliant with all of it. My PCP keeps mentioning that he wants to start weening me off of the oxy even tho he told me in the past that if my GI and pain specialist said there was nothing they could do to get me off of TPN, he would continue to treat me palliatively until I find a new palliative doctor that will accept non-oncology patients. He does not seem to be willing to honor this now which is so frustrating bc he clearly lied to my face. I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s doing this bc again, my current regimen is working and not causing additional harm and my other doctors confirmed that there is nothing else they can do to help me and they called him to do a peer to peer meeting to make sure they understood this and told him they are okay with the oxy long-term as well. I understand the stress doctors endure bc of the laws but that doesn\u2019t justify any of this. They have free will so if a chronic pain patient is begging for early refills all the time, weening is justified but this isn\u2019t the case most of the time. The majority of chronic pain patients are compliant and I know every state has their own laws regarding controlled substances but in some states (including where I live) the prescribing doctor legally cannot force chronic pain patients to ween off of opioids if they are compliant and not showing signs of overuse. Most doctors (like mine) seem to hope that their patients are not familiar with these laws which is why they tend to try to force chronic pain patients to ween so it\u2019s important to become familiar with the laws in your state so that you can call your doctor out if needed! We cannot fight for better access to pain management without proper education about these laws! This page and youtube channel are very helpful and important so thank you \u2764\ufe0f",

If the next practice doesnt use NarxCare it wont make any difference.The PDMP is real easy, just dont get the same drugs from more than one doctor.Check your local board of health and pharmacy and tell them why you feel you should be flagged. Im sure the DEA has a toll free number, but unless youre a doctor or pharmacy, you dont have enough assets to draw their interest. Im sure they'll still take your confession, however. Cause everybody knows YOU did it, and YOURE the one responsible....You'll feel much better if you get it off  your chest and confess....Allow me to provide a personal anecdote. My pharmacist called one day to tell me the state board flagged me, because I lived more than 10 miles from the pharmacy. FORGETTING ITS IN THE SAME BUILDING AS MY DOCTOR...My response was 'F**k them, does the state pharmacy board want this on the local news?' Crickets....so I suppose not. These people have a lot of stupid ideas backed up no science at all. Except the science of opioid paranoia. Red Flags and any talk about them should be treated with contempt, as they are based on stupidity, like my example. Whole Lotta Dumb.....",

Amitriptyline makes me very drowsy so it helps me get into bed when it kicks in - but if I try to do anything else while drowsy, it's like I'm drunk and can't coordinate my limbs! It's like I don't know what's going on, and keeping my balance is very difficult.I started at 10mg at the end of September, but it didn't do anything for the joint, nerve and muscle pain so I'm allowed to up the dosage to 100mg if I need it, upping 10mg every two weeks. It relieved my pain a bit sometime in early November, but now it's sadly back. I also wake up at least four times every night, covered in sweat from nightmares.I have most of the listed side effects, unfortunately, so I'll ask my doctor if I can change meds when I see her in January.",

The NSAID made him sick and the gabapentin did nothing of course, since it\u2019s not made for that kind of pain. I questioned the doctor and was like \u201cummm that\u2019s a medication for nerve pain\u2026 and this is not nerve pain\u201d and she said \u201cI know, but we have to give him something and we aren\u2019t allowed to prescribe opioids anymore.\u201d Poor pups and kitties!",

Like right then. My cat was better in 3 days.I got a rash the doctor wanted to do steroid injection. No let\u2019s not mess up my bones with steroids. So he gave me a cream for fungus; that didn\u2019t work so he gave me a different cream that didn\u2019t work. Three weeks later I still had a rash. I wish I was a cat just scrape my arm.My old cat goes to the vet the vet actually touches my cat. Goes up the spine looks for bumps found arthritis took an xray gave my cat ibuprofen right then same day. I\u2019ve had X-rays that show bulges in my spine; I can see where my spine is just wrong it\u2019s that bad but I\u2019ve never had a doctor touch my spine and ask does that hurt. My acupuncturist who does touch my spine said my spine is awful but can\u2019t help.My other cat goes in and is pre diabetic. A change in food  and timing of feeding and add some herbs and it loses weight and it\u2019s better. For my friend she gets a phone app a script for insulin $$$ and her life revolves around food management and numbers. Because she refuses to change her diet and get off her recliner.",

I\u2019m an Indian healthcare patient and so it\u2019s limited. I\u2019ve quit smoking weed which was the only time I felt normal and I miss being without pain for two hours at a time. I miss not hating my lemon of a body and now my husband doesn\u2019t want me to smoke again. He thinks I\u2019m better off without it but dear god it hurts sometimes. I\u2019m in constant never ending pain which spikes frequently. The only difference is what level of pain I am at the moment but it\u2019s always there. I feel so torn and stuck so I\u2019m laying in bed but it\u2019s just wallowing at this point like this post.",

        "text": "I'll give you some useful tools that have worked for me.Infrared sauna and red light therapy: both of these have helped a lot with chronic pain especially in the neck, back area, wrists, and feet. Especially in your case this could be something that could drastically benefit you. I noticed that once I started using it In less than a week I noticed massive difference. First I started going to the gym using their infrared sauna. And then later went on Amazon and bought myself and infrared sauna. It's definitely worth it especially if The pain is constant everyday. The red light therapy device i got from redlightman online. if you do plan on using the redlight use some kind of cbd topical with it. Helps ALOTTTT MORE with healing!!! The red light helps the CBD penetrate deeper with the vasodilation and absorption. Can't recommend it enough.Redlight device from: (Redlightman)Ginger extract with bromelain: both of these compounds have a systemic effect on lowering inflammation and is very similar to curcumin which is the main compound found in turmeric. I noticed that my baseline pain is a lot lower now ever since I started supplementing both. I like the brand nutricost and bulk supplements which you can find on Amazon. They have great productsCBD topical and CBD tincture: I noticed that ever since I started using CBD topically and some CBD internally that this has done a drastic shift and helping me deal with pain. I take a CBD pain relief gel topical on my areas of inflammation and pain. And then I take a CBD tincture internally and this helps with systemic inflammation. This combination is truly remarkable. If you do go for the CBD pain relief gel get either the 3000mg or 5,000 mg it's definitely worth it and it lasts you over 3 months. I would say this for sure is my top three go to's for when I'm in pain. Which is almost always lolHighly recommend this combination. The muscle CBD pain relief Gel is from Herbal Garden Essentials . And the CBD tincture I get from Charlotte's Web. I like Charlotte's Web a lot just because they pretty much started the whole CBD movement in Colorado.Last thing I would recommend which is relatively new and it's form for dealing with chronic pain is ketamine therapy. I have used this company called joyous And I use their lozenges That dissolve in your mouth. It's a microdose and it drastically has helped with my mental health and as well chronic pain.Definitely look into the sauna and CBD topical/ Tincture Those two have been a miracle for me. helping take care of the inflammation with the cbd daily can help with healing and recovering.Hope this helps and gives you some kind of direction",

I can certainly understand his concern about smoking cannabis, but what about medicinal edibles? Cannabis gummy chews? Many do not contain THC if thats the \"freakout\", you can get them with varying amounts of both THC and CBD, which is non psychoactive, so you wont get stoned but it can have other pain benefits. They have topical rubs, oils and such.Your husband sounds like a bit of a fool. Pain doesnt build character, it just hurts. Its disappointing that your physical comfort is not a bigger concern for your husband. I dont want you in pain, and I dont even know you. It seems the closer you are to someone, the stronger that sentiment should become....You do whats best for you. Talk to your primary care doc and ask them about pain management until you can get in to see the pain doc. You may want to call the pain clinic a couple times a week and see if anybody canceled. I dont want to freak you out, but they probably do some injection procedures, and people sometimes have second thoughts about those injections. The doc wont make any money taking an extra long lunch. See if they can slide you in early. Hang in there...",

It\u2019s legal where I live, so my doctors all know I smoke to help the pain and to get some occasional sleep.

It almost sounds too good to be true, but I've seen the huge change in her, so it piqued my interest.Her physician prescribes buccal (absorbed through the mucous membrane of the cheek) ketamine to take daily on a schedule (she uses it before bed). Apparently, this super low daily dose resets the pain receptors or something? I don't fully understand the science of it honestly.I'm not looking for any medical advice, just anecdotes from anyone who has tried it - positive, negative, or neutral experiences.",

Everyday I wake up at a 3 or 4 and the pain climbs to an 8 by the end of the work day.  This deep burning weighty pain that goes my back from the top of my t spine to under my bra line.  The only thing that TRULY helps is laying down and taking the gravity off my thoracic discs.  But I do get 15mg of Percocet a day that I split into a pre work dose and a post work dose.I teach hs fashion.  I genuinely like my job and I want to keep working.  But the schedule is grueling.  I see 134 students a day and advise a club with 110 students so my day is constant talking, moving, bending over ect.  I\u2019ve got ice packs I rotate throughout the day, a tens unit, Tylenol, lidocaine patches\u2026.all the things.So this past week, I was getting observed later in the day.  My last 3 classes of the day (out of 7) I usually feel like sh*t so I took my pain meds dose earlier that usually do so I wouldn\u2019t be in exhausted pain for my observation.  I felt like a whole new teacher! I wasn\u2019t in pain and cranky at every question asked.  It definitely highlighted how much I\u2019ve been dragging myself through the second half of the school day and how miserable it is!This is just a vent because my dr is currently trying to titrate me down so I can get pregnant.  I\u2019m working on getting an high risk obgyn who would consider keeping me on pain meds during pregnancy but my current drs opinion is to put me on disability for my pregnancy so I don\u2019t need pain meds.  I can take 3 months prior to delivery off and still keep my job.  It\u2019s all complicated.  But the one day this week made me realize how much I would benefit from 7.5 3 times a day, I could keep working not be miserable the second half of the day.I\u2019m still searching for non opiate related options as well, but it\u2019s definitely frustrating when there is an option that could work in the meantime\u2026but I can\u2019t have it.  I WANT to work, and see friends and be a good wife but with the pain I have I hate I have to pick basically one from that list.",

I'm prescribed the basic gaba+cymbalta and I use (legal) THC/CBD daily.  2 years post MVA and I get my wisdom teeth removed, I'm sent home with a few Tylenol3s with codeine. And for the first time I was pain-free. No teeth pain. No neck pain. No back pain. No hip pain. No leg spasms. No electric shocks. It was like breathing air for the first time. And it was short lived. I spent months after my dental surgery grieving because I tasted my previously pain-free life. I while Istill wasn't technically functional due to how out of it I felt, I tried to imagine what a daily low dose would do for me.I'm still thinking about that feeling of the absence of pain.

Having high BP from untreated pain for your entire pregnancy won\u2019t be good for you or the baby, so that is something to consider. I am in my 50s and have been on pain meds for almost 20 years. It\u2019s not ideal, I get people judging me for it often, I have lost people I cared about over it. But they are the only meds I have found that actually help my pain. So I am confident in my decision to take them. People will criticize you, especially if you are taking them while pregnant. I\u2019m not, but people will. Just do what is best for you and your family, and under your doctors care. Good luck!!",

I hope you're okay now.I'll NEVER forget what it was like when that's what pain was like many years ago. Pain is pain.Her: you're all hunched over, what happened?Me: I'm a special case and you're better off not knowing. Really.Her: Come on, you're ok telling me because you don't look sick.Ok, I warned you. I've got a rare type of arthritis that will never get better. So far it's taken my career away which was a VERY big hit. I was a Union Organizer and Field Rep. Helping workers was everything to me and I was lucky enough to have done this for 22 years.We lost our house, cars, health insurance and more. In the past 11 years I've spent 43 days in hospital, lost most of my teeth and even had to quit smoking. Seriously, I miss smoking and if a safe cigarette was made, I'd still be smoking. That sounds awful but I'm out of vices.Her: I gotta go.There's a nationwide shortage of Morphine right now and I'm just about to start week 5 without it. I was taking 45 mgs a day and tapered quickly to zero. With it I was holding steady at 4ish and now I'm at 7 to 9. I,ve had 3 spine surgeries with donor vertebrae and lots of titanium. Thanks to the dead person who donated the bones.I'm supposed to take 45 mgs of morphine a day. Recently I started to wonder what life would be like if I didn't take all my pain related drugs. Now I know. Thank goodness weed is legal! Now I still have Cyclobenzaprine. I take ibuprofen, acetaminophen and weed. Yay me!I pass for looking good and my cane makes me look like a distinguished older gentleman- lololol! I guess I still make pain look good AND my body is so handsome I have to keep the door locked! Lol! Reality is very different.I hope this random note is okay. I'm here for all of you.Peace and Love",

Still better than I thought it was gonna be!! People really don't understand all the extra little tasks we have to do just to be half as 'normal' as most people. And that if we don't perform those tasks, we hurt ourselves more trying to be 'normal'.And all those little extra tasks are extra taxing because we (mostly) didn't have to do any of them before pain.  Having to relearn how to do so many things we had on automatic, like showering, cleaning the house, freaking leaving the house, etc. Now we fight through the pain to discover how to perform these tasks as painlessly as possible-which means more extra steps, more energy.  So much more effort and thought into everything.It's exhausting and demoralizing, and painful.  So, I'm chronically snarcastic\u00a9, and I talk to my legs and spine as if they are separate from me.

I've seen every excuse from \"the pain made him do it\" to \"he was radicalized by pain\" to \"that CEO was pure evil and had it coming\". But no one seems to be claiming that LM was a grown adult responsible for his own actions and the resulting consequences.Ostensibly, because he had chronic pain, he should be held to a lower standard where he bears no responsibility for his choices. If he develops a narcissistic complex in which he elects himself judge, jury, and executioner, so be it... \"the pain made him do it\". The question I would pose to those celebrating him is, does the same low bar apply to all of us? Are we to be looked down upon and perceived as savage animals unable to regulate our emotions or control our actions?This murder should not be celebrated by the chronic pain community. If anything, it reflects poorly on us, inviting outsiders to view us as uncivilized maniacs using our pain as an excuse to commit violence.",

I\u2019m a doctor, and I ended up needing spinal surgery which took me out of training for 6 months after \u201cpushing through\u201d chronic pain for 4 years.I genuinely got asked if I really wanted to have the surgery by my supervisors because it would mean having to take time out.I opted to work in agony, forgoing my pain pills until I got home because I knew that I couldn\u2019t make clinical decisions under the influence of opiates and benzos. I got told I would lose my place in the programme and be deemed unemployable anywhere if I took the time out.I was essentially threatened with losing my career if I didn\u2019t show them all my scan results and doctors notes as my \u201cexcuse\u201d for needing time off work.My cord compression got worse and worse. I had muscle wasting. It was only when my surgeon explicitly stated to them on my request that my surgery was urgent and necessary, and that and delay could result in paralysis, that they granted me sick leave to have the op. They actually sent one of my peers to \u201ccheck in\u201d while I was in ITU to find our when I\u2019d be back.Now I\u2019m back at work, people still say about me \u201coh, she\u2019s should be in her 7th year, but because of her time out she\u2019s doing 6th year competences. She\u2019ll say it\u2019s because she wants to ease back in, but it\u2019s definitely because she took break\u201d. I\u2019m actually doing my 6th year comps because I was in blinding pain throughout I\u2019d actually like to achieve them again and experience the training properly.",

I\u2019d do things in gym class and be so out of breath and in pain and I just could not understand why other people did this for fun, because I just assumed everyone felt like crap after exercising. Nope, it was just me and my broken body and autoimmune system.

I\u2019ve got diagnosis and treatment now and I\u2019m doing a lot better. Never gonna be an athlete and I\u2019m just fine with that.

His staff called me a drama queen because I could not stand up and walk from the car to the office building to the elevator to his office. Finally, my husband told him he wasn't able to take care of me as much as I needed and the surgeon had to do something. The surgeon looked at me, agreed I was very pale, and decided to admit me. His office was across a skybridge to RI Hospital.I was so dehydrated from vomiting, my kidneys had shut down. It was hours before someone told my husband that IV fluids would fix that & I was not going to die from having no working kidneys. Once I was admitted it still took 4 days for them to figure out that my colon had been punctured in the surgery a month before. I didn't get septic & die because I formed an abscess that wrapped around my liver. I had surgery to resection my colon and was denied adequate pain meds even in the hospital after 2 major abdominal surgeries in 4 weeks. I have so many horror stories of that hospital, I could write a book.",

        "text": "Best of luck with it all. Its going to take some time post surgery, before you start moving normally. You do not want to bend backwards, but generally you should be easy on your body for a couple months (usually its around 8 weeks). They you have to do a bit of physical rehab to heal the stuff around the surgery, muscles ligaments, all that stuff that hurts when you stretch it. Then you should be able to judge how successful the procedure was. So its going to take a while. Surgical recover isnt something to rush, but I'd expect at least one lap around the hospital bed the 1st day or so, you want to get on your feet as soon as you can, just dont do anything silly, like bending to pick up something you dropped.  Ring for nurse.You will be in a pretty serious pain immediately post op. Theres no way around it, they just carved you like a Xmas turkey, and put you back together. Its gonna hurt. But the anesthesia gases like to hang around in your lung tissues, so between that, and hopefullly adequate analgesia, you should sleep a lot those first few days. Thats exactly what you need after any surgery, rest.Just a few ideas about how to treat your post op pain, do not be afraid to scream or create a scene if the pain relief provided is inadequate. The squeaky wheel does get the grease, and they sure wont want you disturbing other patients in the ward. With spine surgery, they should be fairly liberal with pain meds. Should. Just make EVERYONE aware of how youre honestly feeling, keeping in mind, its going to be uncomfortable for a while no matter what. But  the pain should become slowly more tolerable, and eventually be better than when you walked in. If you have a vertebra thats sitting on a nerve, you should feel a lot better once this all normalizes.You cant rush healing, it happens at it own rate and every body is different, so its hard to tell you much beyond generalities. As a guess, I would avoid Rugby games for the next 6 to 18 months. Going to the gym might be okay, besides a good idea, but do PT of some kind first. Physical rehabilitation is usually part of any major surgery, may as well let the insurance pick up the costs.They may do a little rehab in the hospital, before youre discharged, enough to get you moving around with a walker at least. But before they discharge you, they should have some sort of rehab plan. I know my last surgery, they wanted to send somebody to the house a couple times a week. I declined, since there was a surgical issue with a hernia that complicated the post surgery stuff, I just wanted the cantaloupe sized bulge out of my belly. I do want to touch slightly on shit like that, things that can screw up. Dont be surprised if when you wake up from the surgery, if youre numb in some weird places. My last spinal surgery (to remove a tumor in the thoracic spine), the surgeon cut/nicked a nerve than apparently  controlled feeling across my chest, and the pinky edge of my right hand. It took a few weeks, but the feeling eventually returned, with no further issues. So how you feel waking up can be really different from the \"finished product\". But if you notice stuff like that, say something.I never had replacement surgery, docs seem to favor fusion when a replacement will often do. There are some concerns with reliability of lumbar replacement, since its got to support everything above the lumbar spine. Bone is apparently better than titanium, but I dont think so, or they'd be transplanting Weird Uncle Harold's hip bone, when he's done using it. Supposedly replacement is better as far as healing goes, but they do so little of it in the lumbar spine, its really hard to judge things like success rates.How soon is your surgery? Do you have enough time to get another surgical opinion? 2 docs telling you the same thing can remove a lot of anxiety. Ask your primary care what they think of this treatment plan. You got to keep all your docs in the loop on this, they should all know youre having this surgery, so if you cant contact your surgeon (who could be working on a patient, for who knows how long) these other docs can step up to help.You are going to get through this just fine. Its never an easy thing to have surgery. But the docs found something thats broken and theyre going to repair it. Eventually youll feel better, but dont expect surgery to work like a pill, this will take time and some work, thats going to be uncomfortable, its a process that is only just beginning when they close the incision and wake you up. Any recovery, from anything medical, always takes too long from the patient pov. Try to be a patient patient, and best of luck.What kind of questions do you have? Might be something we can answer for you, regardless. The only dumb questions are the ones that go unasked. Lots of dumb answers, but very few dumb questions....Hang in there",

Nobody seems to know why I have multiple disc \u201cbulges\u201d, one that\u2019s herniated, and daily pain. I\u2019m a healthy weight, I do my PT every day, I do \u201chikes\u201d on the treadmill and strength training 5-6 days per week, and yet sitting for longer than 30 minutes and anything leaning over slightly (ie washing dishes, washing my face/brushing my teeth) is painful. Anything high impact (running, too many jumping jacks, etc) ruins my week.I wish I could tell you I\u2019ve figured it out, but all I seem to get is more referrals to PT and lidocaine patches, which keeps my pain at baseline, but doesn\u2019t get me pain free. Doctors don\u2019t seem to know what to do and hate doing anything beyond conservative treatment because I\u2019m younger.One thing that I will suggest is getting a referral to a PT who specializes in spine\u2014 I saw one who was amazing and gave me exercises but also went through different things that may aggravate my pain and helped me modify/cut out certain things. She went through my gym routine and helped tailor it to my pain, which no other PT has done for me!",

        "text": "Check it out and be sure its a blown disc. They can refill them with a sort of replacement gel, I cant recall the name of the procedure, but my FIL had it done a few weeks ago and hes been pretty happy with the results. If the problem is disc herniation or bulging, the discs have no sensory nerves, so they can get well chewed up without issues, but if any of that disc material runs in to a nerve....Thats why with most cases of DDD the actual problem is usually a compressed nerve rather than a disc issue.Its rough trying to lose weight with pain. Since physical activity is pretty limited, you need to become calorie conscious. Your average burn of calories is between 1200-1500 daily. Thats like a big Mac happy meal. Eggs are good low cal eats.I tell a lot of people to try breaking a pill in half if its too strong. You can do the same with food. Eat half a sandwich, leave the other half for later. And its not a joke, if you put an ugly colored light bulb in the fridge, all the food looks very unappetizing and grey. You might still be hungry, but it wont be from the looks of the food.See if any of your pals have a gym with a swimming pool.  The resistance of the water and the lessing of gravity can give you amazing results. A lot of pools have wheelchair lifts if you need one.The best way to get them to understand you cant cross the kitchen to toast a bagel, is to tell them you cant cross the kitchen to toast a bagel. They arent mind readers, some docs are not particularly smart, either. Say what youre feeling. Its actually far better to tell them something they can relate to rather than \"pain=8\". That doesnt mean a thing, even if they ask for a pain number again and again. Be direct. If your doc doesnt do direct, get another doctor.The weight could play a huge role in your pain, particularly if its worse now. Its just physics, it take more effort to move more mass, and the cheap parts our bodies are made of, will wear out faster from more force. It may be beyond someones ability to address, but it still doesnt make it easier on a body. But any doctor should certainly understand that weight loss isnt a today solution. Its fine advice, like eating right, plenty of good quality sleep and exercise. But not too realistic about near term solutions...You should get a fresh MRI if its been a while. Herniations can resolve over time so if you had one, it may no longer be there. But theres also a weak spot left behind in the outer wall of the disc where it can re herniate. Dont expect a new scan to look like the old one. Maybe theyll see something they can fix?You need to ask your doc, \"what can you do for menow?  You know it suddenly occurs to me if your doc was that concerned about your weight you should have left the office with Wegroovy (wegovy, a weight loss drug thats all the rage) or something similar. They probably have a box full of coupons for low co pays. Im liking your doctor less and less, I see them addressing less and less of your concerns and its pissing me off. You?If so, maybe you should say something. They might become useful. Or it will be clear you need to go elsewhere for care. I mean in the US, but youre not wrong about it feeling hopeless. The guy in charge of medicine for the next 4 years, had the better half of his brain eaten by a worm. Apparently it got the better half from what we see and hear. My, the acorn has fallen far from that tree:\"What is objectionable, what is dangerous about extremists is not that they are extreme, but that they are intolerant. The evil is not what they say about their cause, but what they say about their opponents.\u201d \u2015 Robert F. Kennedy (SR)I hopped in here to try to cheer you up, now Im depressed...

    "content": "Hi all, I\u2019ve never posted here before, but I\u2019ve had chronic joint pain since about ~3 years ago that has gotten worse and spread to other parts of my body. I\u2019ve seen roughly 14 different doctors across 9 different specialties, had every possible test run on me, and all of my doctors have been completely clueless (though I\u2019m very grateful not at all dismissive). However, I was recently able to see a rheumatologist for the first time after waiting 8 months (!).She did some physical tests of my strength and touching the areas of pain to see if that made it worse. Everything was normal including my blood work, xrays, and MRIs. I described my symptoms as the following:-continuous sharp joint pain in both wrists (primarily right) that started 3 and 1 year ago, especially with use or when bending wrist up and down -nerve pain in back starting 2 years ago (again, nothing wrong with my spinal cord at all) -sporadic, sudden, and sharp pain in hips and knees starting less than 1 years ago -chronic fatigue (which she said I was diagnosed with as it was on my chart but I was never told this? I definitely believe it though) -chronic migraines -dystonic tremors in hands that started BEFORE pain (taking medication for, works wonderfully) -restless leg syndrome (I actually forgot to mention this one)I also noted that standard physical and occupational therapy did absolutely nothing to help. The only things that help the pain are wearing a brace which I\u2019ve been wearing on my right wrist 24/7 for almost a year now, heat, and I also had two cortisone shots. Another really important thing is I have NO INFLAMMATION in my joints. I also have no indication of an autoimmune disease. Based on all measures I should be completely healthy but I\u2019m obviously not. Up until very recently I was running 5 miles a day and still able to do just about everything, and even now I still try to make it work.The opinion of the rheumatologist was that I had a very atypical case of CRPS. She recommended acupressure, two different types of physical therapy, visiting a chronic pain clinic, optional counseling, and also to see a(nother) neurologist about my headaches. She told me \u201ceveryone gets better\u201d which I didn\u2019t really believe but I was hopeful. She did explain to me the typical symptoms of CRPS and that I didn\u2019t have some of those but I was happy to have a diagnosis. However, when I was researching further it seems like I don\u2019t have ANY of the symptoms of CRPS. The ones I saw were-temperature changes -color changes -swelling -sensitivity to touch and temperature -throbbing or shooting joint pain -caused by injury (usually not to the area) -affects the extremities -tremors -stunted nail growthThe only one of these symptoms I truly match is the tremors which started before I had any symptoms of pain. The joint pain is different than described in the symptoms here and I also have back pain, not just pain in my extremities. I don\u2019t match any of the other symptoms at all. I might be able to see another rheumatologist soon but I feel pretty hopeless. I\u2019ve seen just about every doctor I possibly can and done every single test with no results. My pain just keeps getting worse day by day and it\u2019s getting harder to live my life. I\u2019m so young and I\u2019m worried how this is going to affect my future. I\u2019m still planning to explore all of the recommendations I was given (haven\u2019t started yet) but should I settle for this diagnosis? Those of you who have CRPS, does what I have sound like your condition? Do you have any other symptoms such as headaches or chronic fatigue? My primary doctor says they\u2019re likely related. I\u2019m just not sure what to do and any help is appreciated.TL;DR: was diagnosed with CRPS, not sure if that\u2019s really what I have and I\u2019m not sure what to do with my pain continuously getting worse.Edit to add: I haven\u2019t been given any pain medication (though I really don\u2019t think I need it at this point), but I take a lot of ibuprofen for my headaches. Over the counter medicine doesn\u2019t help my joint pain because there\u2019s no inflammation.Edit 2: someone onr/Chronicillnessresponded to my post with their experiences with dystonia in it\u2019s early stages and it sounds remarkably similar to what I have, so I think I\u2019m going to speak with another neurologist and try to explore that route. Thank you so much to everyone who has responded, I appreciate you taking the time to share your experiences, resources, and kind words.",

For me burning pain , sharp pain, & stabbing pain are always. Pain meds take edge off. I had a sympathectomy done which caused nerves to reroute. Now I have it in both legs, back, & some in head & neck. I do have neurostimulator that was implanted in 2007, was replaced in 2014, had new battery in 2023. Now having symptoms of overstimulating nerves. Don\u2019t just agree to that diagnosis, make them do their jobs & do more tests. I hope you get help & find relief asap.",

I was in new unfathomable amounts of pain. I brought in all my meds which included my prescribed MASSIVE bottle of ultra concentrated morphine by the surgeons. It was near full. I had only taken 3 doses at the point. (Which was less than what I prescribed, for reference) Very long story short, they did not take me seriously, did no tests, said nothing was wrong, while informing me that I need to seek help for my drug seeking behavior.?????? I LITERALLY COULD HAVE GOTTEN HIGH 8 HOURS A DAY FOR 3 WEEKS WITHOUT LEAVING THE COMFORT OF MY HOME, WITHOUT HAVING PEOPLE BITCH AT ME. YOU THINK I CAME HERE TO GET A SIDE OF JUDGEMENT WITH MY HIGH?The other time I've been accoused of drug seeking is when the surgeon (different surgery/different dr) prescribed me Norco 10s without me saying anything as normal post op care. I asked for Norco 5's instead because the 10s make me feel high, and I don't like that feeling.You literally were going to give me a higher dose, I asked for a lower dose of the same medication, but apparently, that's drug seeking?",

        "text": "THIS!! Also if doctors prescribed opiates/other helpful controlled substances to ppl who are complicit and will never abuse them, I feel like this would reduce the amount of ppl who feel the need to turn to the streets to seek relief from their mental/physical pain. Most origin stories I\u2019ve heard from dug addicts seem to be at least partially a result of the broken healthcare system and doctors prioritizing their own liability risk over adequately and compassionately caring for their patients\u2019 QoL. Before I was on palliative, my family would always joke that if they knew where to find some street drugs they would risk their lives/jail time to get them for me so that I could have even just a little bit of relief. Obviously my family would never actually do this but I know there are many ppl who are truly desperate enough to do this even when they\u2019ve never broken a rule in their life, which is ironically almost the same argument doctors tend to use against prescribing short-term opiates after procedures/injuries for ppl who have never had them before. The whole argument against opioids tends to be one-sided and assumes everyone will get addicted and inevitably start overusing them when that isn\u2019t always true. In the past, doctors would ask me if anything ever did work for my chronic pain and of course I was honest and admitted that oxy truly is the only thing that has helped improve my QoL but also that I am more than willing to try any other suggestions since I don\u2019t wanna be dependent on oxy forever if they have a solution that will work just as well. Of course they never offer an adequate/reasonable alternative!Thank you so much for writing out this detailed post and sharing it with us bc I feel less alone now that I know others are going through the exact same things as me even tho we are on different chronic pain/health journeys. I had never heard anyone else talk about their PCP sending them to pain specialists for opioids and then the same pain specialists saying they don\u2019t prescribe that stuff so I assumed this was just my doctors gaslighting me to make me give up. It\u2019s so discouraging when you find something that works but they refuse to keep doing it bc of their own personal fears. It can feel so lonely bc they\u2019re basically giving up and saying \u201coh well, it is what it is! see you next month to collect my paycheck for not doing anything beneficial for you!\u201dI will never understand how these doctors live with themselves knowing they\u2019re practically stealing money from disabled ppl who are suffering way more than they could ever truly comprehend at the hands of their ignorance. They will never know if they don\u2019t try and they still have free will so if the patient starts showing obvious signs of abuse/overuse they can simply choose to stop prescribing these drugs. I even had a doctor tell me that opiates make chronic pain worse which still doesn\u2019t make sense to me bc I think he was forgetting about the concept of tolerance building which is why ppl may need increased doses after long-term use. It seems like we know a lot more about this stuff as the patients than they do as the doctors bc I guess med school doesn\u2019t teach how to do proper independent research and the importance of constantly studying the new science info that\u2019s being discovered every day lmaoIt feels like an endless cycle but there are some good doctors out there that are willing to take the risk, especially when you\u2019re compliant!! These doctors are rare but they do exist! It took me a long time to find a doctor willing to do this for me but I did eventually find one so don\u2019t lose hope \u2764\ufe0f",

I\u2019ve decided I want to specialise in the intersection of chronic pain and substance use, because honestly there are literally so many people who are NOT DRUG SEEKERS being denied care and referred to a drug and alcohol clinic. Those that do get on an opiate script are then taken off (with or without a taper) unexpectedly or told they\u2019re, in my case \u201ctoo young to be hooked\u201d.So many of my clients who use heroin initially started because of being denied pain treatment for legitimate, often structural, pain. They were told their pain wasn\u2019t real, and refused treatment, so went to find some relief themselves. Not drug seekers, just people trying to find some relief.I\u2019ve been (when I have the spoons!) reading studies and prescribing guidelines, because I really want to write something about opiophobia (I learned that it has a name!) and how subjective and honestly just discriminatory it is to label someone a drug seeker and refuse medication. Trust me, I understand that opiates have their risks, but I personally think that the leaving someone undermedicated is more detrimental to their wellbeing.",

Also, states and income strata matter.  The people happen to be in CA and in WA, and entirely from high income knowledge / finance type professions.  So their selection is going to be more informed and they are not going to feel squeezed by any gaps in care--it might seem irrelevant to them.If a state is hardcore in regulating their industry, patient outcomes are going to be better.  I don't see a US State dimension in any of the data that I just found.  If they did not take the trouble to break it out that way, and only felt that US citizen/not citizen was the only regional dimension worth caring about, their responses could be skewed.  I find it hard to believe that they'd be that sloppy but idk--who knows?  Anyway, CA is one of the most populous states in the USA and CA has a 94% insured rate, which is an all time high and they are higher than the US average by a couple percentage points.  So if they are sampling people based on a % of the insured portion per state, they could be overweighting CA.Lots of ways this data could be messed up.",

Ers have pain plans for patients with scd where they get immediate pain control while still in waiting room and like 3 doses of iv opioids and then admitted or discharged.i don\u2019t understand why they automatically get high dose opioids, immediately, but other chronic pain patients get dismissed and treated poorly.I am not invalidating scd, I understand it\u2019s a horrible disease, and I\u2019m all for people with it getting whatever they need\u2026im asking why it\u2019s treated so differently. There are other horrible diseases out there too. Other people suffering like OP that get accused of drug seeking and tossed out.I\u2019m struggling to understand how these drs can be so compassionate towards scd patients and in the same breath be so cruel to other pain patients.",

If it\u2019s the latter, go to the ER and say you\u2019re there for mental help eval.However, if you\u2019re looking for meds, don\u2019t go to the ER. You need to see your PCP or specialist and plead your case. The ER is there for emergencies only. The GI bleeding would be something they\u2019d care about but I\u2019m guessing you addressed that last time and they just told you to follow up with your PCP? The issue with ERs is that they\u2019re there to basically sure you aren\u2019t going to die or if you have something broken. They\u2019re not there to prescribe meds. I don\u2019t go anymore unless it\u2019s something other than my normal symptoms. Example, I had numbness down my leg one day on the same leg as I have my chronic pain in. It was different so I went in to make sure it wasn\u2019t a blood clot. I got some scans and no meds and then sent home.Never ever say you\u2019re suicidal if you\u2019re in search of pain meds at an ER. The minute you say that, it\u2019s a mental health crisis and the pain becomes the secondary issue for the medical team.I\u2019ve been in your place many many times as I\u2019m sure we all have. America is a shitty place to be in pain.",

Supported by a long paper trail of orthopedic appointments, physical therapy, and scans. Unfortunately where I am only the primary can prescribe them, and pain management can only do nerve blocks and such. I see pain management as well, but I really had to be firm with my doctor that I needed this additional pain management option. Make sure you also emphasize that you are open to any treatments that could reduce your pain level, such as ablation, etc. They like to see you are seeking solutions, not just pills, and you are very aware you don't expect the pills to \"cure\" you.",

        "text": "Ok don't laugh but this has been life changing for my amputee father and for myself.Dad's prosthetic leg which is very painful snapped in half at the knee and couldn't be repaired. He couldn't even get around inside the home and it took more than 10 months to get a mobility scooter covered. To cope with the time he had no leg or scooter I built a 360\u00b0 manual wheelchair you could push around with 1 foot.I took a really nice office chair base with strong mesh support (for airflow), just the seat and the rolling mechanism and I replaced the wheels with 360\u00b0 pivoting Rollerblade wheels and now my dad can get around the house. He likes it so much it's his main mobility device in the home since the scooter is far to bulky to comfortably manage.The back of the chair and the arms are not attached so that he can use it as a brace to hold onto and pull himself up from sitting on the floor. This means he can sit down on the floor and play with his dog, and we all know how much those small joys mean to us when struggling with chronic pain.This chair works best in homes without carpeting so we only have a small 5x8 rug kept off to the side for him to sit down comfortably in the floor, and to protect my knees when I assist him.I'm also disabled and if Dad is asleep or comfortably seated I will use his chair to cook in the kitchen, or help me clean the bathroom floors, tub, toilet. It's great because it's height adjustable.If anyone wants exact model info on the chair and wheels I'm happy to oblige.The only downside is the wheels may need to be replaced every 12-24 months and that it's not safe to fall asleep on this chair as you may fall off. If you are prone to falling use the chair back and arms.It sounds silly but this chair has given my dad so much added freedom inside the home and greatly improved his quality of life which also improves mine. I wish I had thought of this sooner, he could have been enjoying life so much more and in less pain.",

I waited too late or sure I could have found a better deal on the glass  ones I normally use for holiday spice gifts. But they were ridiculous for some reason this year.  Haven\u2019t bought any since post covid either until this year. I stocked up on grinders and bottles by the cases 8 or so years back since I love to make homemade made gifts from things I grow.I finally ran out of the original grinders and the small fancy jars Id sometimes put em in.Funny watching everyone pull the caps to sniff salt yesterday. They had laughing hard. I walk into the kitchen and there\u2019s a group of people all trying to pop off the top so they can sniff the one they claimed. The tops  on the bottles  wicked on wicked tight\u2026So it made it extra comical. I was like just toss the lid when ya get home.  Ya really don\u2019t need it anyways unless ya want it on when not in use.I smoked the salt so that\u2019s what the real gift was.  I need  to get another batch knocked out tomorrow. Since I still have a bunch of people to give them too.I grow and make some of my own spices. That could take it to next level for some of the things having it in a battery grinder.

You want me to be more than I can give you.So, I ask: What do you, Society, expect of me?I\u2019ve given you what you\u2019ve  asked of me, but I am no longer what you want me to be.I spent my life kayaking, rock climbing, hiking and being a good active citizen. Pass the tests, go to college, smile, be positive, be active. Be, be, be more.I do not eat junk food nor fast food. I feel guilt having half a ginger ale. I am tall and at the exact healthy weight I should be. The weight society requires of me.Every job I\u2019ve ever had was a physical labor job. I sweat, I bled, I ached.I\u2019m an artist who\u2019s created solo exhibitions and been in publications. My name was even once up and coming\u2026until it slipped away along with the control of my hand. Something else I did not cause.Society approves of you if you\u2019re \u201cspecial\u201d.But then I got sick and more sick and even more. All of my conditions are genetic or arose from the latter. But I tried. I did not give in. I did not ask for these.What have I done to fail society?What have I done to make them think that I\u2019m faking my disability, wanting to be lazy, wanting to lie here in agony?What in my history makes society think I haven\u2019t worked years through the pain \u2013 hooked up to TENS units, slathered in creams, gels, foams and salves. Eyes burning of menthol and skin laced with kinesio tape adhesive. Braces on multiple joints and my stomach shredded up with too much Ibuprofen and Tylenol. Taking shots of Pepto, ginger and Tums.All those years I bit my tongue and pushed and pushed and pushed through every wince, scream and tear\u2026as I knew society expected of me.Being emotionally assaulted by doctor after doctor. Even s\u20acxually. Made to feel beneath them, a cockroach\u2026garbage. I still moved, moved, moved. I did not plead. I did not beg. But my body gave in. And yet, I still pushed. Because that\u2019s what I was taught to do.What have I done to society to make them treat me as if I deserve my pain?Why do they turn a blind eye to those who suffer with it chronically? I do not know war, but I still cry for those who experience it.I have had 20 years of therapy to heal the trauma my mother and attackers caused me. I obey my PT, my PCP and my therapy. I fight through the PTSD so that I can be a better me. I have dotted al the I\u2019s and crossed all the T\u2019s and still constantly challenge me. I do my duty and pay my taxes and even give to charity\u2026\u2026with what little I have.I have been jabbed and stabbed and poked and prodded and belittled and abused and mutilated with needles and injections and condescending words.And yet, I\u2019m looked at as a parasite. Something to not be trusted.Do tell me\u2026what more do you expect of me?",

I overachieved, I did graduate-level research while still in high school, got competitive national scholarships, excelled at uni, got a good job at an early age that involved a lot of outdoors work, bought a house before I was 30. I did everything right, I followed all the rules, and even through my teens and 20s I worked through my endometriosis, often not even complaining about it and rarely taking time off.But then endo decided I was having too good of a life. Chronic pain in my early 30s, racked up a metric fuck ton of medical trauma from doctors treating me like I was sub-human, developed a whole bunch of complex health issues. I had to beg to get surgery. Even going in my endo specialist doubted me. They found more than just endo too. Because diseases are usually PROGRESSIVE and get worse if you don't intervene, like cancer, the thing endo is compared to the most.I'm at a point where I cant really eat anymore. I'm seriously looking into how to survive off broth. If I eat food, my body goes haywire and my pain gets so bad it takes me to dark places.And no one listens. Or cares. Not even my family. I'm just suffering. Suffering so I can struggle to get thru my work day to collect my meager paycheck, half of which goes to rent alone, to attempt to keep myself housed. But this isn't enough to keep me going for much longer, not that my body is going to be able to keep going for much longer. Turns out food is vital to survival.",

Some don\u2019t even get the relief and they just exist in it. They don\u2019t live. They\u2019re not able to live the life they want. They can\u2019t even get out of bed sometimes.I feel for you and I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to endure. It\u2019s not fair. You do all the things & put yourself through all the agonizing interactions with doctors, therapist & even family. Yes family! It\u2019s so taxing. Physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, even spiritually. What kind of loving god would allow such suffering to be had by good people?I don\u2019t have any words of encouragement. You\u2019re already fighting the fight. A fight you shouldn\u2019t have to fight. All I can say is stay strong & don\u2019t let this terribly cruel world darken your heart to complete black. To me, that means THEY win! We WILL keep fighting the fight as well. Maybe someday, this landscape where already suffering people have to continue to suffer through will get a sunray of change and hope in that their quality of life will be that of quality and not just  survival. \u270a\ud83c\udffb",

I point this out because I think you just have to find people in similar circumstances to truly understand you.Society as a whole just has no idea of the struggles, pain and and fight you endure on a daily basis. Nor do I ever think they\u2019ll ever understand until they themselves experience it. You certainly are valid, wanting it to understand you and it is sad that there is so little compassion to be found.Now, your doctors absolutely should be a safe place and understanding people and have no excuse for the way they have treated you. The only thing I can advise there is keep searching for some Doctors that are supportive and I also would print off your eloquent statement and hand it to him to help educate their ignorance.So, try to find people who can understand you and also understand and accept yourself as you are now- I\u2019m having a tough time with this one. It may be a small piece of Society/group, but at least it will be a safe and healing one. You have fought the good fight long and hard and are welcome to relax and heal your spirit here with nothing left to!",

        "text": "PT is wonderful and I\u2019ve never learned so much about my body. I think the biggest value in it to me is just that I have a doctor I\u2019m spending an hour a week with, who is watching me move, and taking my body mechanics into play when looking at the whole picture. I\u2019ve spent the last 20 years in diagnosis limbo where nobody has any specific idea what\u2019s wrong or how to fix it.I personally haven\u2019t had much luck with the antidepressants usually used for pain, however I have been on antidepressants on and off for the last 10yrs or so for depression and I think my biggest advice with them is to not get discouraged by the trial and error. Be open and honest with your doctor about the side effects you\u2019re worried about so they can try to match you with medications thst better fit the profile. If you\u2019re having side effects you don\u2019t like, there\u2019s always the option to switch medications\u2014 not liking side effects is a valid reason to stop taking it but just make sure you work with your doctor so you\u2019re following safe taper schedules.Antidepressants come in a bunch of different classes, they usually start with the tricyclics for pain.  The thing with side effects is the reactions vary so wildly across people. Effexor is my best friend\u2019s holy-grail zero-side-effect medication whereas it\u2019s my worst reaction to a medication to date. On the other hand, Wellbutrin and I are friends \u2014 it helps with ADHD a little and I only have side effects for about 2 weeks when starting it. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve taken it, but I\u2019ve been considering going back on it. I think some studies have suggested Wellbutrin was also quite effective for treating neuropathic pain.I like taking care of my whole person. For me depression makes pain worse so mental health management and pain management go hand in hand whether that includes medication or not.",

But now that able people need it, it's being done. It's hard not to feel resentful but I have to remember everyone can only compare to what they have experienced.

Shoulder painDegenerative tendinopathy ROTATOR CUFF INJURYINJURY ORIGIN:- 4.5 months ago I was practicing boxing and I noticed pain in my left shoulder while doing most musclular pose and a slight bump at the end of my clavicle.DIAGNOSIS:- Supraspinatus & Subscapularis tendinosisTREATMENT:-1ST DOCTOR:- My first Dr. Told me to do rest so I rested for two weeks then I continued my workout at home( I do bodyweight workouts and some armwrestling training)OUTCOME: it didn't pain while doing workout but but I still had that pinching pain while doing most musclular pose Then one day I was doing pullups and I raised my hand above my head and a nerve got pinched on my left shoulder it didn't pain while in rested position but while raising my arm it did, It went away after 2 mins and I visited another Dr.2ND DOCTOR:- He told me to do rotator cuff rehab for a month and no activity till 15 days then I can start light workouts then can return to my old schedule after a month till then rc rehab+icing and he also gave me collagen supplements for three monthsOUTCOME: I did what he told me to do but I started working out after 15days(light) then after a month I started my old schedule. I still had that pinching pain while most musclular pose and now my shoulder gets impinge while doing hammer curls and barbell curls. I visited that doc again and he told me to stop working out till 3-4 months and do shoulder rehab. Then I visited a physiotherapistPHYSIOTHERAPIST:- He treated me with TENS machine everyday for 15mins and 5mins ultrasound for a week then he replaced ultrasound with red light(heat) for 10mins and did some shoulder exercises.OUTCOME: pain went away completely then he told me to start doing some pushups I did 2 sets of 10 pushups on first day all going good Next day he told me to do 2sets of 20 My pain came back then he advised me to do 2x15 I still had pain but it was less The other two days it didn't hurt and I was doing some pushups, inverted rows, and lateral raises Then he told me to start doing normal workouts with less volume So I did 2sets of OHP, pullups, pushups, hammer curls, inverted rows, lateral raises Now my shoulder doesn't impinge while doing hammer curls but I am afraid it'll come back when I'll go heavy. 1-2 days later my pain came back then went away in 2-3 days and I stopped visiting my pt nowPRESENT: my pain is less but it always comes back when I workout. How can I fix it? Problems I had(not doing workout so I don't have one now):- 1)pain while movement similar to most muscular pose(scapula protection with shoulder internal rotation) 2)shoulder impingement while heavy hammer curls and barbell curls(more with hammer curls) And it is not inside the joint but over the joint I have some nerve/tendon over my AC joint which gets impinged and it goes away after 2-3mins aur it gets fixed if I do deadhangs. 3)if I do deadhangs/pullups while in a position where my shoulder is in front of my hand position (behind the neck pullups but in dead hang position) then it hurt during and after wards(when my raise my arm above my head) 4)doing caption/Lateral raises with a 2kg(4.5pounds) plate with internally rotated shoulder hurts a little when my arm is near parallel to my shoulder height. 5)little discomfort/pain in my left shoulder at the bottom range(streched part) of heavy OHP what should I do now to fix my shoulder pain?",

It was overall an amazing fun experience (unlike anything I'd ever had with my family lmao)I tried to keep my activity to a low last night because I know my body can't handle very much. I sat most of the night but danced a little here and there.I'm in so much pain now. Like almost a 10 out of 10 pain.It seems like when you suffer chronic pain you just aren't allowed to have ANY enjoyment in life anymore. We're going to fianc\u00e9s uncle house in a few hours now and I'm honestly not sure how I'm going to make it. I can barely move as it is, and I haven't really told anyone in his family about my chronic pain and disabilities so I know they'll ask me a ton of questions because I don't think I can mask this very well it hurts so bad.Anyway, merry Christmas to those of you who celebrate it! I hope your Christmas is filled with much much less pain than mine is \ud83d\ude05",

I\u2019ve called them telling that I will be late, but tbh I don\u2019t see it happening. I feel bad already because I have a 5yo and they are also waiting for him to come. I got a call from my sister like how I\u2019m not going to my parents for Xmas. I love them all but disability doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s Xmas. I will see if it\u2019s improves in 2 hours and maybe I will pop in for a minute. But I feel awful physically and mentally because of that. We always have to pay the price for little happy moments.

Heres my little \"trick\"....Next time you fill your RX take the red cap off of your old bottle before you throw it away. Every morning count out your daily allotted meds (I remove 4 from my bottle) and place them in the red lid (this way you NEVER have the.... did I forget to take it?? ) On any given day sometimes I dont have to take pill #4, so I put it into a separate container. Next thing I knew, after a couple of months, I had a nice little stash of extras IN CASE I cannot get my meds and I dont want to get sick! The trick is to never take out of that \"stash\" unless you absolutely have to (RX late, etc). Also, your pill counts will always be perfect, as you count them out in the AM. It worked for me!\u2764\ufe0f",

I suspect there was some calcification, but in any case, I had liveable back pain. A lot of it was due to compensating for the spasms, so I'd get really sore and knotted somewhere else in my back.Three years later, wear and tear, a couple of falls and fender benders, and I had bad spasms and pain. Woke up screaming in pain. It would come and go in spasms, with no pattern to the start and stop. Intense shooting pain from mid-shoulder blade area to fingertips. Took my breath away.Was given morphine in the ER, had an MRI. The old ruptured disc pieces had finally started to cause problems, pushing into my spinal cord. I got fast-tracked for surgery. It went well. Good news, they did a discectomy and fusion, so that joint shouldn't bother me. Bad news, 3 above and below are also bulging. Yay bad genes and poor calcium in pregnancy for my Mum.Anyway hang in there. I found a PT with a doctorate. He was the best, by far, of the dozens of pts I've seen in my life.",

        "text": "Yes, mine healed-ish.... I herniated C5-6 and C6-7. It took 4 months for the hand numbness/pins & needles sensation to mostly go away, and about a year to stop hurting entirely. I consulted a lot of surgeons because I thought I would need surgery since I had numbness and noticeable tricep weakness. Day to day, it no longer hurts, but it flares up every once in a while (about every 12-18 months), sometimes severely enough that I need steroids, gabapentin, muscle relaxers, meloxicam, and physical therapy for a while. Some of the numbness never healed, so my thumb & pointer finger on the left side have numb areas. My tricep is a bit weaker still. The best surgeon I consulted told me to wait as long as possible for surgery as it often has unintended consequences or is a difficult healing process. However, I cannot be as active as I want. Anything that strains the neck makes it flare up and I have to be careful how I sleep. I cannot do any exercises that make you use your neck to hold the head up. I will likely get surgery some day, but only when I can no longer get rid of the pain during a flare up with the standard treatments I use.",

        "text": "I was diagnosed with a spinal stenosis and herniated disc in 2020. The pain was unbearable and constant for about 6 months. My surgeon didn't want to do surgery bc I was in my 20s. I walked with a cane even around the house. I bought a wheelchair. I stayed in bed a lot.It got better so slowly that I didn't really register it getting better until one day the pain was manageable. I still have sciatica that flares horribly, especially when I stand for too long. I would guess that the worst of it was the first year, but I don't really have a clear timeline for when I was \"healed\".Then over Thanksgiving a few weeks ago I re-injured myself. I haven't gotten x-rays so I can't say how bad it is, but I'm on muscle relaxers and increased pain meds again. It's already getting better, but it was really scary to feel that way again. I think I caught what happened earlier than the first time, because I knew what this pain felt like. I've also been less stubborn about resting.I say this because I think it's important to bring up that while things can heal and you won't necessarily always be in that same pain with those same symptoms, it doesn't necessarily mean that you will go back to being just like someone who never injured their spine. There can be weakness, scar tissue, etc. that never really goes away and continues to effect your life.Equally, surgery causes permanent changes that can be difficult to predict over time in a young body. Healing isn't linear and recovery isn't always full.But congrats on your progress! I'm happy you're feeling better.",

Chronic pain is a fact, a truth, a medical reality.  It\u2019s not as intangible as an ideology or mental aberration.  I find it very hard that they will be able to demonize a legitimate medical condition simply because of the actions, rightfully, so by the way if they are for the reasons, I think they are, of one man who was tired of the system .  So I disagree with your assessment.  While it is possible, I think he indeed achieve his objective and drew quite a lot of attention to this subject.  There is still quite a lot that has to come out in the wash with Trump entering office and the spooks being let loose on the cartels. Those they aren\u2019t officially affiliated with already that is.",

He was saying outside prison \u201cthis is unjust and out of touch,\u201d this made me realize a lot about him potentially. He did this because HEALTHCARE is unjust and out of touch. It is completely just for him to be arrested without bail until sentence by jury, even if that jury lets him go with a slap on the wrist.I\u2019m grateful for the awareness, but a \u201cmuh sexy vigilante\u201d cult is not what we need. All these CEOs scared for their lives now thinking every common man a villain, I wonder what this CEO would think or do or say if instead he had been kidnapped for a week? Would he come back to work and realize his choices affect people\u2019s livelihoods and tell his co workers? Would he realize his week of captivity is nothing compared to the chronic pain that someone can get at any age with no relief and suicide treated as only mental health?If he wanted to be captured as it seems, why would being arrested be unjust and out of touch.Imagine if the cops find this guy after a week of being kidnapped in the woods eating a steak that Luigi is barbecuing and he decides to not press charges out of empathy? Perhaps his family, coworkers, and other CEOs would not be angry at those in pain but instead realize what\u2019s possible in our worldI understand his actions as I think we all do. But the more I hear and see the more I realize this isn\u2019t the awesome perfect situation that so many people on the popular page of Reddit or Facebook think.Writing \u201cdeny delay depose\u201d on the bullets was brilliant. Monopoly money brilliant. His manifesto and book reviews also brilliant. But could he have done something more performance art that would raise as much awareness? What does killing achieve that a kidnapping or theft couldn\u2019t if he is so willing to throw his life away for a cause?",

And it can. I mean look at the lengths the FBI went to in order to undermine and destabilize the Black Panther party, a party willing to take up arms to protect their communities (sidenote: they didnt just do that, but that was held against them to justify further violence against them) and how much excessive harm was done to Black people & the attitude toward Black Power movement in general. But there was already harm before that, that is why these movements are formed. It emboldened a lot of people and did a lot of good things to help.Retaliating against us would be the part that is wrong.  Even if they didnt, they are already harming us. They will continue to, whether we give them a reason or no. We should not have to be perfect, model humans all the time so we dont negatively affect how people, who already dont care about us, might see us. And it is not fair to blame one another for how others treat all of us.Lastly, we do not yet know the validity of any of the claims about him, or whether he is even the culprit. So don't jump to panic just yet. There is a lot of misinformation that will only make things more confusing, and anything coming out right now should be heavily scrutinized.",

I agree and empathize with much of what you\u2019ve written. It\u2019s so important that we give ourselves the space to deeply reflect and engage with our thoughts and emotions, especially given the current sociopolitical climate.And also, the alarmist tone might alienate people who are desperately trying to hold onto what little hope they have. So many of us are beyond our breaking points. As malicious as the system is, we need to embrace even the smallest pieces of hope when they come. Symbolic acts can spark change and open up conversations that might lead to better outcomes. Right now, what we need most is solidarity, encouragement, and guidance to help us get through tomorrow. We can speculate about what will happen, but no one can truly see the future. At the very least, it brings me some degree of comfort knowing that these discussions are happening all around us. We work with what we have and hope for the best. It\u2019s much easier said than done, I know.I send love to you all and wish some semblance of comfort for us.",

I broke my thumb recently and went to an ER clinic hoping to get a painkiller or at least a shot of morphine that would give me some relief for a day. The tip of my thumb was completely severed! The Rapid Med Clinic doctor offered me Naproxen for pain. This is what I take for muscle spasms. It does NOT help acute pain. I could\u2019ve picked up Aleve from Walgreens or CVS and saved two hours and $300. Additionally, he forgot to call in the antibiotic he prescribed. Luckily, I had antibiotics at home so I didn\u2019t bother picking up. I was in excruciating pain for two weeks. By the third week, the pain level went down from 10 to an 8.

Not only that, it scares doctors into switching fields where they \u2018can\u2019t\u2019 Rx opioids. I had a wonderful PM that lets his DEA \u2018license\u2019 lapse because of the climate of pain management. It put a lot of pressure on him, he was hearing a lot about pts committing suicide because what theyneededwasn\u2019t what he wasallowedto do in accordance with Rx guidelines. It heavily affected him and I absolutely do not blame him. He did make sure to speak to the doctor taking over for him so he could be sure I wouldn\u2019t be yanked off my meds. And she was wonderful! I had to switch because I moved, and then again because the new one was pushing shit on me I was already told was a bad idea for my case. My new one is on the same page the doctors previous to that one were. But I absolutely loved that doctor, and it made me really sad. He got into that field because he wanted to help people. And instead he was put in a position where he felt that blood would be on his hands, that his hands were tied and he couldn\u2019treallyhelp anymore. He had to take some time off from patient contact even. The genuine sadness in him when we talked about this made my heart hurt.Patients can be put in an \u2018us vs them\u2019 mindset (and so can doctors). We tend to forget that they\u2019re also people. They don\u2019t have free rein with those prescription pads. We tend to see providers as untouchable- \u2018they can, they just don\u2019t want to\u2019. They should have to risk their licenses and freedom (because jail time is a possibility)? That\u2019s not a fair way to think.In the end, it\u2019s just that we forget we\u2019re all human. Some doctors don\u2019t see people when they look at us, but the opposite is also true. We don\u2019t see people when we look at doctors. It\u2019s so much more complex than people think.But you know what my issue is here? People applauding the shooter and forgetting that Thompson isn\u2019t the one suffering. The people that loved him are. But they\u2019re not seeing his family as people. As much as they say \u2018we\u2019re not treated like people\u2019, they\u2019re not treating his family as people who just lost someone. I\u2019ve now only seen one person mention them, consider them. They\u2019re victims. And no one seems to care.(And to be clear, I know Thompson was a CEO, I\u2019m just talking about doctors because they are also affected by this. The people that pay for this are Thompson\u2019s loved ones, chronic pain patients, and doctors in the field. He\u2019s dead. He\u2019s not paying for shit)",

        "text": "Did it specify intense pain or simple pain? It's behind a pay wall to meIt's possible if a person is asked and their pain level is not terrible, yet it never lets up, then they answer yes, and if that's so I believe it would be 1/4. Many I know who played sports or had an injury earlier in life, reach a point as adults and have  constant nagging pain sometimes for years until surgery or sometimes simply forever on.Also possible when asked for a study they will admit it when normally, if not debilitating, they fake their days through it.For example, I'm a private person, don't want anyone who doesn't have to knowing of my Rx, don't want to complain about pain, so only a few people know. Daily when greeted I smile and say \"fine.\" On the days I can't leave the house, I make up an excuse not condition related for missing activities. But a survey I'd likely be truthful. Casual friends don't know of the pain. Close friends might suspect. Even family often doesn't know how bad it is.",

But I\u2019m also 33, so my friends around my age are just starting to get knee pain, back pain, and injuries that will likely get worse with age.  Endometriosis is very common and can cause severe pain. Back pain is very common and there are seemingly endless possible causes. I used to work with a caseload of ~40 clients and the majority of them were on disability and most of them had some sort of chronic pain for various reasons.People tend to hide it, so they probably just haven\u2019t told you, if you really think you\u2019re not interacting with people with chronic pain all the time. If they\u2019ve dealt with it long enough, they may know that saying @me too\u201d when someone else describes their pain can come off as dismissive, turning the direction of the conversation back towards themself, or presumptive of your pain levels, etc. It\u2019s not surprising that it\u2019s common, it\u2019s more surprising how many people don\u2019t realize that, or that chronic pain could be around the corner for them, whether they have a healthy lifestyle or not.",

And sometimes that's bad because then I can't enjoy it in the moment or I realize I have to go home or my pain gets really bad afterwards but in general I think its kinda good because it gives me the possibility to experience some things I probably wouldn't have done if I had thought about my pain before planning it. Nowadays (having had this pain for more or less 7 years) i think about it more than I did 5 years ago but still not a lot when planning my \"future\".Also, when thinking of the far future, its kind of the same. I still subconsciously think that my pain will somehow disappear in the next few years and then I'll be pain free for the rest of my life. Which obviously won't be true but my subconscious did not give up on that believe yet and it makes me feel less sad about the rest of my life.Idk, I think I just wanted to know if its the same for anyone else?

I just find the hope/disappointment cycle to be really depressing and I'm trying to find a way to push back.)Here's what I have so far:Squares for every time a doctorTells you to lose weightTells you your labs are normalTells you it\u2019s menopauseRefuses adequate pain medicationSends you home without offering treatmentAsks if you are seeing a therapistAsks if you have depressionImplies that you are drug seekingTells you to exerciseImplies that you are complainingImplies you should see someone else without offering a referral.Maybe also multiple squares for things you did, like:Did physical therapyMade a healthy mealExistedRally after a treatment doesn't workTry again after one of those bad doctor visitsAddress peripheral health problems",

    "content": "ive seen such a lovely community here.. so I hope you don\u2019t mind me rambling/ranting a bit here but\u2026 sorry to those who also understand this experience\u2026 I\u2019ve been 8 years diagnosed w/a rare condition(SMA superior mesenteric artery syndrome - mesenteric vein compresses intestine+stomach) that no specialist /surgeon ive went to at many different hospitals and only been turned away, its so much more gaurunteed that no one will help me... regardless of being diagnosed, regardless of my providers and nutritionists knowing i cannot tolerate food, despite seing several surgeons confirming they cannot perform on me because my recovery would be too risky if my organs cannot absorb any food/liquids i try to consume... ive given up looking for help... sometimes i think \u201cwhat if i post online and someone sees it and shares similar/same experiences and knows where to find help??\u201c but unfortunatley... for us all.. I only find others in complete defeat or worse.. death reports.... my heart is so broken and only breaks more seeing all the others who suffer searching for the immediate help they deserve, i have no more energy and my body is already so small.. Im so scared i dont have much time.. i will keep making wishes but.. it sometimes makes me more miserable knowing that thats all i can do.. dealing with us healthcare I don\u2019t understand why they won\u2019t send me to a research facility but even with this diagnosis and my many others: ulcerative colitis, sj\u00f6gren\u2019s, fibromyalgia, endometriosis.. constant pain.. always throwing up.. even stomach acid.. oral medication won\u2019t work my arms are battered from infusions and injection meds.. cavities from always puking.. I\u2019m never taken seriously\u2026 I\u2019m a young girl twenties, underweight for obvious reasons. But they all dismiss me saying \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t bother with so many appointments you should be living your life\u201d and well.. somehow my state is only worsening and still I\u2019m being ignored.. my stomach and ribs has turned purple in areas\u2026 but when I visit the emergency room from pain they tell me they can\u2019t do anything I\u2019d need surgery\u2026 then all over again I meet a surgeon, they turn me away\u2026\u2026. it takes so much energy I don\u2019t have to ask for help that evidently is not there\u2026 and no support around me because no one else around me really understands what \u201cnot being able to eat\u201d is like unless maybe they\u2019ve had food poisoning by chance? in fact my family will even eat or throw away the things I do try to nibble on leaving me without options more often than not.. as liquid vitamins and supplements are NOT inexpensive\u2026it\u2019s easy to get left behind and somehow ignored.. it\u2019s so much easier for them to not care that things even reached this state and.. now I\u2019m just scared\u2026 I\u2019m so much paler and smaller than I\u2019ve ever been my whole life.. and the longer this goes on obviously the worse i feel and manage anything.. i feel so desperate and hopeless and the same time... it's torture.... I dont even have a space to escape to expect care.. i never expect to be helped when i ask for help... its so confusing feeling this neglected... incontinence and puking constantly... no energy for showers... forget cooking applesauce packets were my go to sometimes only a single packet for that day.. and i dont even sleep on top of all this because i just cant from the pain i cant even comfortably lay down because of the constant pain in my abdomen and back.. all of this and still i am on no medication besides muscle relaxers and the most that does is let me know im clenching my jaw 24/7. If its this easy to neglect others.. it crushes me into thinking im not wanted...ive been alone my whole life and its not looking any bit of better... was striclty sheltered and never even left the house much either since i was always ill.. ive never experienced much of the world not even nature.. all i focus on now is doing anything to help myself regain any functionality to even try enjoying anything before i focus on just surviving.. but that too.. things just ends up overwhelming... Imagine trying to pick the most tolerable thing to try to consume when youve already been puking your own stomach acid for days on end.. i never comment/interact online much either... i only started more recently to seek help.. but well...sending all the love to you all... still hoping maybe one day someone who can help will hear us.. ending the rant.. thank you if you read/saw this post.. i hope something nice occurs for you\u2026 i take it very much to heart\u2026 when even birds fly to my window\u2026 watching me just be in my room out of curiosity from my own window\u2026. or as i lay on the floor.. another spider in my rug bold enough to crawl right beside me... another new year... unsure if its my last",

If i am doing everything right, then why am i the way that I am. For most of 2024, I just stayed at home all day long looking out at the world, watching it go by without me. You are not alone. We are here.When you need to vent, then come here to vent. No judgemental words. Just compassion and understanding and maybe just maybe some hope of a better life. We suffer together, yet we are separated by geography. We are your family of strength and caring. We all have curses of disease, accidents, genetics, or just life trying to crush us.I can not offer you physical relief, but I can offer you whatever strength, mindset, courage, and laugh to help you get through this journey that we call our lives.Please come here as often as you need to.",

You may be asked, but theyre just checking on you, they already know what youre taking and who's prescribing it.I know I dont have to ask this really, but why are you going to a pain clinic? Medication? You probably want the effects of the medication on your pain, and dont care much what treatment they give you, so long as it works for the pain...Thats the best way  know of to avoid any thoughts of drug seeking. is not to discuss drugs. Tell them about your pain. Tell them about your current treatment, and ask what they can do better...that shouldnt require much drug talk....Best of luck...",

    "content": "Chronic pain patients deserve the facts about prescription opioids, especially at high doses. A 2011 study published in JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) sheds light on just how low the actual risk of overdose death is\u2014even before advances in overdose prevention.High Doses, Low Risk:The study examined patients prescribed >100 morphine milligram equivalents per day (MEDD) and found an annual risk of death from opioid overdose of just 0.25%.What does this mean?0.25% = 1 in 400 chance of overdose death per year.Statistically, someone could take ultra-high doses every day for 400 years before expecting to die from an overdose.2. Compare This to Coumadin:Patients on therapeutic doses of coumadin (a blood thinner) face an annual risk of death from hemorrhage of 0.32%.This means high-dose opioids are less deadly than anticoagulants\u2014yet opioids are demonized while coumadin is routinely prescribed without stigma.3. Risk Is Likely Even Lower Today:Since this study was conducted in 2011, overdose prevention has improved significantly:Narcan (naloxone): Widely available and carried by family members and first responders.Technology: Devices like Apple Watches can detect falls or changes in vitals and alert emergency services, increasing survival rates.The chance of dying from an overdose on high-dose opioids is likely even lower now than when this study was conducted.4. Patient-Centered Care Matters:Chronic pain patients should have the right to decide what level of risk is acceptable. For many, a 0.25% annual risk is a reasonable tradeoff for the ability to live a functional, pain-free life.Medicine is about balancing risks and benefits, and opioids shouldn\u2019t be treated differently due to stigma.5. The Study Reference:Source: JAMA. 2011;305(13):1315-1321This study debunks the myths surrounding high-dose opioid risks with clear data.If you\u2019re a chronic pain patient, share this information and advocate for evidence-based care. With modern overdose prevention tools, the risk of high-dose opioids is lower than ever\u2014so why are so many patients suffering needlessly?",

It's been years of specialists, diagnostics, surgical procedures, medication trial and error, PT,  gaslighting, pain psychologists, etc.  Long-term employment is gone, my condo is gone, savings and stability are gone, a good night's sleep is gone.It's really ironic, sad, and on some days infuriating that the medication that caused all of that is still being prescribed and in circulation, but the pain med that I've been on successfully for years that helps...doctors and government bodies are always looking to take it away because \"it is unsafe\" and \"could be\" harmful long-term, even though I tried so many others unsuccessfully over the years.

        "text": "The incidence of addiction is so tiny, but its huge to addicts and those who treat them. Mostly to those who make the money from it. But making it seem common, brings in more patients, who might just be undermedicated. They have totally tried to discredit the idea of of pseudo addiction. And if you dont think pain will drive a person to extreme behavior, you havent been watching the news for the last month or so. Its just amazing how the addictive behavior stops when the pain is treated adequately. When it doesnt stop the behavior, you found a rare bird, 1 in 400. But addicts want addiction to seem normal and that its the fault of a drug. Theyve done a great job of it, but to be believable you would also have to believe most addicts get started on these drugs for pain, not for getting high. Which is absurd. Only about 2% of ODs have any medical history that would have put them in the same room with an opioid. Its not a hard thing to research. Do they? We cant even get them to recognize and separate out street drugs from medications, statistically because they know 98% of the time Rx drugs arent involved in an overdose. Thats why drastically lowering the Rx rate of opioids hasnt done jack to the OD rate. You'd have to be a low grade moron not to see this, which is why they keep playing the same games with RX drugs and wondering why things dont improve. Low grade morons...",

        "text": "Having been battling a chronic illness & the resulting chronic pain for decades now, I could write a book about the opioid hysteria..how it affects me now, and how it's affected me over the years. I firmly believe that no one in their right mind would choose to treat pain this way .... and go through the ridiculous hassle it's become. Anyone who knows what it's like to walk into an ER or urgent care center, and feel all of the empathy sucked out of the room the moment you reveal an opioid dependency after being labeled a drug-seeker. Anyone who's asked for pain medicine only to be offered Tylenol and an addiction counselor ... would choose another way if they could.Unfortunately it is too late to put this cat back in the bag. Now that the country has firmly decided that politicians (even conspiracy theorists), not medical professionals, should be in charge of public health. As a result, the motivation for any future actions from legislators will be placating grieving parents and being able to claim some type of effort to fight this epidemic. No one hears about the misery, or cares about punishing sick people and their doctors for wanting to feel better.Promises to invade Mexico and making opiod medications as difficult as possible to obtain will help them get reelected & maintain a \"tough on crime\" facade even though this is so obviously a public health crisis & not a criminal justice issue. The latter keeps our private prison system profitable, which is just another way profits are prioritized over human suffering in this country. We should prepare for this to get a whole lot worse as billionaires and insurance companies take complete control over our medical care.I believe the next step will be more prohibition, and an attempt tp fulfill the promise of the first Trump administration to simply cut the opioid supply by 1/3. How can a group largely consisting of sick people in pain hope to organize an effective resistance? More patients will be forced to find relief on the streets, more will commit suicide, more will accidentally OD, fewer doctors will even consider pain management as a specialty, more patients will be punished and even incarcerated. It is for these reasons that I am going to choose surgery - an option I've resisted for years, but it may be the last best hope at being able to function without ever needing these medications before it becomes impossible to get them.",

    "content": "I filed a complaint against him on Sunday late night. I received a call Monday night from the hospital complaint office. It was someone I\u2019ve known since I was 13. She called me to tell me she couldn\u2019t handle my case but that her colleague would call me back next week. I told her I\u2019ve never been treated that way and she slipped up and said \u201cyou did the right thing filing a complaint. Oops, I can\u2019t say that. I mean it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019ve written it down.\u201d And then after we chatted some more about her recent wedding and her sister opening an Asian restaurant she whispered he was going into retirement. I also called my PC dr. I told her about the complaint and told her what happened. She asked me if I was ok and that she wouldn\u2019t even have been able to say what little push back I gave. She was contemplating filing a complaint too because she just received a letter from him to do physiotherapy and stop my pain meds. When I asked her to explain my NMR/MRI to me because he had said it showed nothing, she looked (because she hadn\u2019t looked as the letter didn\u2019t mention anything) and she flipped out. \u201cThis is nothing?! This needs to be seen by a surgeon and treated asap!\u201d I asked a friend to ask her boyfriend that\u2019s a radiologist to take a look and he replied that I need surgery ASAP. The first open spot is Feb 19. The surgeon that\u2019s recommended is only available on April 2. I can\u2019t take that risk of waiting so much longer. Last 3 days the pain had been getting worse. Worst case scenario, I\u2019ll drive to the ER. Let\u2019s hope I can make it till Feb 19th!",

This year I almost lose hope of trusting doctors, especially clinic doctors always rid me off as young and the pain must be due to stress. Well I did X-ray and it was muscle injury, I\u2019ve said this for months that I gotten more stress and depression on daily basis only after the pain started, it wasn\u2019t pain due to depression and it wasn\u2019t all in my head . I knew the feeling of muscle twitching non stop especially when I lay down is uncomfortable to sleep and clinics keep rid me off as stress and anxiety. All I wanted was proof it wasn\u2019t in my head and now I got X-ray to proof it\u2019s an actual injury in my shoulder blade . I feel like cursing at them because they didn\u2019t even give me pain relief, the time I was given painkillers and anti inflammatory  patches was after my X-ray in the hospital, because there was actual evidence of my pain .",

I had a doctor from ... Sounds like a. Germany roll tell me your just depressed stop acting like a 4 grader and just go by your self a new dress! That was in 1998. I walked out and cried in the bathroom. I left my x boyfriend and doctor in the room after saying to the doc that he wasted his time and mine. As i cried i remembered a referral from a friend. And digging in bottom of my purse i called and made a doctor appt. The doctor told my boyfriend to reconsider anything with me that i would cost him $. He told me at home and being a therapist with a license i filed i written complaint and l asked if the dr. Had a license to do therapy? If not he was practicing out of his scope of practice.  The tall doc with a cowboy hat and snake skin boots did not call to apologize but his lowly PA did. I said that still did not make up for the demeaning way I was treated. See my therapist as every therapist has a therapist for hours toward license has been a attorney so i learned somethings and key legal phases that may dr. Cowboy shake. However that was 1989 before most doctors started treating us like street urchins and drug addicts. No the problem worse i started following you tube Chronic Pain Warriors UNITED. Who speaks for the things i think and turns off the gaslight we are all given. Please join me there its a great place to hear someone like us fighting for us. Docs have the power to abuse so they do lets stop that.. I have had enough. Lost my good doc for 29 years now i need help as we all do my meds being cut and iam scard too.",

    "content": "Two years ago, I had a double mastectomy with flat aesthetic closure and a salpingo-oophorectomy due to my BRCA2 mutation. I'm a stage two breast cancer survivor. I've been struggling with neck pain that extends to my shoulder and occasionally radiates to my left rib cage. My oncologist suggested joint supplements since I'm on Arimidex. I am taking osteo-flex and was diagnosed with osteopenia. The orthopedic surgeon prescribed muscle relaxers, which I don't use because they make me sleepy and then referred me to physical therapy which helped a bit. I also started seeing a chiropractor but received minimal relief. A massage therapist mentioned I have forward posture syndrome. I'm feeling frustrated about my quality of life and have been told the pain might be linked to physical anxiety. Has anyone else experienced this? What can I do? I am super flat and tight on my chest.https://ibb.co/hRgqS3G",

We\u2019re going to do the injection there, that should relieve everything!\u201dMe: \u201cUm don\u2019t think so but okay.\u201dSpoiler alert: it did not in fact help. It caused me about six hours of \u201crelief\u201d (until the local numbing wore off), and absolutely WRECKED my blood sugar for a week. And then when I brought up the issue about the blood sugar at the follow up, I basically got called a hypochondriac and told that the injection does not in fact do anything to blood sugar. \ud83d\ude43We also tried a non-steroidal injection that was basically supposed to be an uber nerve blocker over the summer.

Let's do that test. What about x? Oh if that doesn't work, try y. In the meantime, get to these specialists. If it's not better after a week, come back.\" She was great, and determined to help me and never once accused me of faking it. In the end she couldn't help me much (other than ruling out some worse diagnoses that I didn't have), but she never let that stop her from believing me, and doing whatever she could.

And to keep me from slightly leaning forward.Another tiny pillow holding up my kindle to read and distract me.Lidocaine patch on either neck or lower back or arm.  Maybe a heat patch on one of the others.I'm allergic to most of the meds that can help.  I used to take vicodin about six times a month, on the worst days, to sleep.  But the docs are too afraid to give it now.  I can't take anything OTC due to reactions now.So, the only meds I have are muscle relaxants, which I take as little as possible, so I don't lose them too.  I made one bottle of twenty last five months last year.  Last visit, doc said go ahead and take them more than that, and gave me ninety, with refills.Massage helps, but we live on limited income now, and spouse used to do it for me, but has had major health issues lately.I can't wear anything with a seam down the leg, because of the nerve issues due to spine issues, where my legs feel like there are huge bruises on them.  If a seam is against that area, it's like being stabbed.  So, nightgowns.Takes me about twenty shifts to get a spot where I can have less pain enough to maybe sleep, lots of tiny adjustments.  Takes about two hours to get to sleep, reading.  Takes about two hours to be able to wake up enough to decide what to do.   Some nights I read a couple of books, because I still have the occasional bad dreams from some personal traumas from years ago.I wake up every time I need to roll over.  My back is such a mess, that I cannot roll over asleep now.  To roll over in one direction I have to push to sit up first.  To roll over the other way, I actually have to get out of bed first, and then back in.It's ridiculous.  But it's my life now.And there are sweet things that make this worthwhile.",

If you were takin 8 T3s a day for months on end, ya tapering might be good. But you're barely taking anything. T3 are so weak, they're literally nothing compared to percocets or morphine or anything that's strong. Opiates aren't that dangerous that you need to worry about being addicted to T3s after taking one here or there. I get a small amount of T3s from my doctor, have had it for a couple years now. My pain has been bad lately and I got thru my 30 day supply in just over half a month. So I've been going over a week without pain meds, and I've had zero withdrawal symptoms. Just bad pain lol.

    "content": "6 years ago I broke my knee playing rugby. I was 33. I had a fair bit of metal put in and lots and lots of rehab. 2 years on crutches and over 4 years of physio. Nothing helped the pain and they removed the metal, which also didn\u2019t help. I had a nerve block injection and was told it may stop the pain for a few months. It didn\u2019t last even minutes. Both surgeries slashed through the main nerves running down the inside of my leg and the nerve pain has been insufferable ever since. I was left of pregabalin for 4 years with no plan for anything else. It also didn\u2019t work and I eventually stopped taking it and now rely on weed to allow me to sleep. I haven\u2019t slept more than 2 hours in a row for the entire 6 years since injury.That brings me to now. After another referral to an orthopaedic dept, MRI and X-rays, they have told me there is nothing they can do. I need to deal with chronic nerve and joint pain for life and honestly I\u2019m so low about it. I\u2019m not even 40, I can\u2019t chase my kids in the park, can\u2019t ride a bike or walk my dog for more than a half hour. I busk in my local town but when it\u2019s cold I can barely walk the next day. My life is a shadow of what it could be and nobody gives a shit. I\u2019m told I\u2019m too young for a knee replacement and have to put up and shut up. Pain management clinic won\u2019t offer anything at all other than going back on the noneffective pregabalin. They won\u2019t consider a knee replacement as in too young \ud83d\ude44I will be reapplying for PIP, disability benefits here in the uk, but I was refused before. I suspect they will reject it again. Sorry had to vent and my heart goes out to everyone else here who has had bad news recently. And also those left in pain. We wouldn\u2019t leave our animals in this much pain everyday.",

Finally, the last surgeon I went to explained to me that it\u2019s mostly insurance companies that won\u2019t pay for one u til you\u2019re 50 because they don\u2019t want to pay for it more than once AND they last about 20 years.  IT SUCKS!!! From the time I damaged my knee at 34 til I turned 50 and had it replaced, was 16 years. But damn! At least I got pain pills during that time!  10 days after turning 50 I had a TKR. Best surgery ever. I\u2019m so so sorry you\u2019re having to go through this!",

        "text": "Wow this blew up more than I expected. Thank you all for your words of kindness. Replying to you all will take a while but there are a few things that have come up a few times so I will clarify them here.Firstly this is the second opinion. I moved since the injury so this is a completely separate NHS trust. I also know 2 people who work in the ortho dept of this hospital and they have independently told me the consultant is the best and genuinly cares. He will do any and everything he can for his patients, but unfortunately there is nothing they can offer to help.There are 2 reasons the knee replacement is off the table. Firstly, as mentioned in here a few times, they have a lifespan. Currently the ones on the NHS last 15ish years. It was explained to me that the first surgery is big. The second one is massive and a third has a large chance of infection and therefore needing amputation\u2026 hence why they don\u2019t want to start that process until you\u2019re dead before the 3rd. How true that is and how medical implant technology will progress in that time \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0fRegarding pain management. It is a speciality in some nhs trusts. They had me in the maximum pregabalin (lyrica) dosage for years. Infact we exceeded that dosage as I was taking all my medication for the day at night. It made me feel drunk so I couldn\u2019t drive etc hence taking it at night. Still only got sleep in 2hr chunks.A few have mentioned that a new knee won\u2019t stop the nerve pain, that is half true in my case. I have osteoarthritis after I work my ass off in physio. They left a 2mm step in my joint and it has worn away the cartilage. I also have a 5 degree extra slope in one of the lobes. Both these things would be corrected with a TKR. Also my PCL is kinked due to the injury which is causing hyper extension. This causes me to fall sometimes in rough surfaces. Instead of sitting at home and recording government help I returned to uni and got my marine biology degree but working on sand and gravel, with algae covered rocks and boat work, was the worst place to take the knee. The risk assessments were insane. So yeah the TKR would make a massive difference to my life in general. The chances are my nerve pain would be worse tbh as they would be slicing it all up again.I needed a vent and this post provided that, but I\u2019m Genuinly taken aback by the good wishes in here. And this is the internet! So thank you all. I\u2019m also saddened by the stories of others in here :(  I feel so sad for those of you without universal healthcare. The NHS isn\u2019t perfect but the individuals in it are amazing and we don\u2019t worry about the cost of anything.",

It's like a giant tens machine. You can't take it home, it's huge. My neurologist had me go through multiple rounds where you basically lay down, have the electrode pads placed where your pain is, and then you get buzzed for an hour or two with electrical stimulation. The bad thing is is that you really have to do it for an hour a day for 7 to 10 days Which is a substantial cost of transportation if you have to go somewhere far away. I was incredibly lucky that my neurologist was blocks away from my house. It helped lessen my pain for months. You feel very relaxed and sleepy and your pain is diminished after a session and the sessions can help diminish pain for the next few months. It basically just completely overload the pain signals in your brain and how they are processed.Maybe you need to call the NHS and tell them that you are getting close to unaliving ideation solely because of the pain and see if that helps? That you have otherwise no other ideation but you are depressed solely due to the amount of pain that you are in and that is valid and that you're pain needs to be treated? I am so so sorry.I'm sure other people here from the UK can help much more than I can but I am so so so sorry. Here in the US it's just as bad. I'm so sorry and I'm sending you such a hug.",

They found like over 100 micro fractures of his knee , they would heal up a bit and then crack back open . He was if I recall 28 yrs old ? , he ended going to Brazil to have a knee replacement. I think he said all said and done with surgery & hospital stay it was like $8-1000 dollars . He did his physical therapy back here stateside thru his insurance which was way more costly than the knee replacement hes pushing 70 now and his other knee is giving him issues says he going to let it go till he can no longer walk or death first",

Unfortunately can't access it for pain, has to be OUD related and then your red flagged for OUD and labeled an addict. Unfortunately again, some here say bullshit got me labeled with potential OUD prior. I'm not suggesting to become a drug addict or anything of the sort. But with the bullshit labels and bias in US healthcare about pain management and addiction treatment, I seem to find that the UK, Canada, Switzerland and possibly a few others with HAT programs (diacetylmorphine/heroin assisted treatment) or tax funded free drugs for people like in British Columbia Province in Canada has is really the best model of pain management/addiction treatment. Not always does one or two medications work for everyone, so to limit people with substances use history and major chronic pain to two medications, methadone and buprenorphine, doesn't always work. People wonder why the drug problem is so bad in the US. It actually shows in studies that drug prohibition being lifted decreases and doesn't increase the use of drugs or recitivism in populations. There is many safe dosing/safe consumption sites throughout places like that and NOT ONE overdose death has ever occurred in those clinics. It took so long for marijuana to somewhat be accepted yet it's still schedule\u00b9 here in the US where it has absolutely no medical use and is very highly addictive which is bullshit. I can't trust the DEA to schedule shit correctly let alone boss doctors around and tell them how to treat my pain, which by the way neither the DEA nor any doctor has a way of accurately gauaging pain that they have no way of feeling theirselves. It's bullshit, whoever feels the pain knows what works best for them and what doesn't. But people's quality of life doesn't matter in healthcare only doctors licensing to practice matters. It's sad. I'm sorry your going through what your going through man. Pain sucks and it does greatly debilitate one's quality of life and ability to do things in general. Its seems the only form of pain releif in this world has been left in your own hands. Papaver Somniferum is no worse than Marijuana and it shouldn't be criminalized anywhere. It is an important flower that we've fought over for thousands of years and it's time we stop that. Morphine and codeine are naturally occuring substances in nature just like THC is on Marijuana, which by the way has many many medicinal values and is criminalized over the greed of money. Papaver somniferum is even worse. Big pharma has played a huge role in where the US government puts boots on the ground and it's all been near or in the golden triangle.

Your knee is F\u2019d and that is what you need. You have to advocate for yourself and believe me\u2026.that is HARD TO DO. I also make sure my husband is at all appointments now because doctors have treated me like a liar and drug seeker. Some ideas that you might look in to: Ask about Botox injections for the nerve pain. I had a terrible neck injury and after going through all of the pain meds available, a doctor suggested Botox. Saved my life. Also, I have a spinal stimulator that just might work on you: worth a shot. Finally, file complaints with whatever healthcare managing for your state/country. The doctors were convinced it was all in my head. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f As soon as I filed the official complaint they did a complete turn around and can\u2019t do enough for me bow\u2026sort of.

I'm sorry you've been dealt this hand. I lived in that darkness for a long time. But little by little I adjusted the way I do things to make it less painful for me. I got a wheelchair which many people don't want to consider. They told me using it was giving up. Nope. Giving up is sitting at home alone when your friends and family are out and about. The chair gives me the ability to go out, too. That doesn't sound like giving up to me. Maybe a cane would be helpful to you. I have many of them, each decorated for a specific holiday or time of year. I made it fun to use them.I know the news seems bad now. Just know that you won't always feel so down about it. Life goes on; you'll still find joy in your children even if you can't run in the park with them. You may have a better chance now with your disability claim, though that seems to always be an uphill battle for everyone on both sides of the ocean.

        "text": "Benzo withdrawal makes opioid withdrawal look like / feel like a walk in the park trust me, I spent 6 months in agony withdrawing from benzos and 5 years later I\u2019m back taking them again every day. Diazepams half life is over 100 hours so even if you take it every 3 days it will still be in your system the whole time. I would just say do your best to keep it as low as possible and if you don\u2019t feel you need to take it then don\u2019t take it. It\u2019s the only thing amongst other benzos or alcohol that helps my pain and anxiety and I have just sort of given in to taking them daily to function, it\u2019s sad and withdrawal sucks but sometimes in my head it\u2019s better than the insufferable pain. Good luck on your journey! Try some high quality magnesium that also helped for my nerve pain and muscle pain!",

        "text": "There are other muscle relaxers that have a lower risk profile. You could talk to your doctor about your worries and ask for something different.Otherwise, check if you can cut the pills in half or quarters. As long as they aren't extended release (which I don't think exists for diazepam) this should be fine. But I am not a doctor or pharmacist. But I myself take diazepam and are allowed to do that.Very important: Never abruptly stop a benzo like diazepam! It can cause serious symptoms like delirium. If you want to stop them eventually, talk to your doctor about how to taper them down. I know this might add to your worries but I'd rather have you know the risks in advance.",

        "text": "Good for you for being concerned. But addiction odds are really overblown. 4%. Thats the world rate of addiction. All addictions. So theres really very little to worry about. 5mg isnt a huge valium dose, about half of the usual for somebody experienced with the valium drug family (benzodiazapines). If you find it too strong, diazepam is usually pretty a pretty easy tablet to break in two. Just watch the crumbs and drug dust. Theyre usually very soft.The basic action your doc is trying to get happening with diazepam is as a muscle relaxant. Its usually better for the muscles of face and head, but its still pretty good at muscle relaxing every place. So if you get loose, try to stay loose. There is such a thing as muscle memory, which is I think what they trying to address with their dosing suggestion of constant use for a short period, followed by as needed use.I understand your concern about medication withdrawal, it can get quite serious with Diazepam. Being one of the more dangerous withdrawal syndromes, its pretty important, if this is going to be a regular thing, that you taper if you need to stop for any appreciable time, like 12 hours. It may take a little longer to feel crummy, every body is different. Unless its daily use for more than a couple weeks, you shouldnt have much in the way of withdrawal. As the months go by and become years, its going to become more important that you taper to avoid any unpleasantness.Take it as directed. Your doc needs to know, if this works, how much youll need every month. You shouldnt have a problem with withdrawal before your next doctor appointment. You never know this drug might suck for your pain, lord knows theres lots of other muscle relaxants to pick from.... Best of luck, I hope it helps. Lets get over that hump first, before we worry about quitting. Hang in there...",

NEVER failed a drug tox screen .Never gave them any trouble. Then one day I knew the \ud83d\udca9 was hitting the fan when the Best PA-C were leaving ...I never failed a drug tox screen & was always compliant with my meds. They wanted to take me off my medication that allowed me to function a somewhat normal lol type of life. I fought to go off meds for a year as I was a patient for at the practice for almost 20!I was always compliant with their protocol. Totally absurd the amount of pain I can be in & expect to function. I am Severely allergic to a boatload of meds & have anaphylactic reactions so Yes...I have tried everything many people have mentioned. I've done PT so many times I have lost count, I am at a normal body weight etc. I TRY to do the best I can on a good day & when I have my bad days I try not to berate myself. I TRY to live a somewhat normal life that is not normal.",

I wonder what caused them to suddenly decide to go no pain medication.  Is it possible that something happened, like a DEA audit?  I know there have been a couple of past pain management doctors who I use to see that left the pain management field altogether due to the DEA doing some type of audit.  This was like 8 years ago.  Some pain management clinics just decide they no longer want to deal with all the stresses and pressure from the state or the DEA, because they literally have to cross every \"T\" and dit every \"i\" on every patient.   I am sorry this has happened to you.  I hope they don't just cut you off cold turkey.",

I forget what number the recommendation is, but its easy enough to find in their 2022 opioid prescribing guidelines.Its funny how guidelines are just suggestions when they benefit the patient but if the physician is benefited, its a LAW. But the guideline is at least 10 months before cold turkey day.I know that doesnt help the utter stupidity of the whole situation. You can probably find someother passages in the guidelinesthat might be helpful, if the docs will listen. Do be aware that the 2022 guidelines also suggest an absurdly low MME limit of 50MME...",

Educate yourself about your own state laws regarding opiod prescribing so you can push back when they feed you the inevitable lies. If you have the funds you might also contact a disability rights attorney. Basically the more muck you can throw into their wheels the better. They will try to bamboozle you into thinking you're crazy for expecting them to provide you with the medication that allows you to live you're not crazy. They are in the wrong and just covering their assess and cow towing to their legal departments pressure all the while cashing in big time on repeat injections and other \"interventional\" pain management \"techniques.\" It's gross and it's a scam.Keep calm and push on while you still have medication to function.

If you do have intractable pain (it\u2019s much different than chronic pain) opioids are the only proven thing to help. Most states have IP laws now that prevent the Dr from prosecutions for prescribing high amounts of opioids for long term use. Otherwise IP causes early death, mostly from heart attacks or strokes.

I hope that they are going to still consider it case by case, and that this will work out for you. But that\u2019s certainly not a guarantee and I know that this is a scary time.When my PM doctor was retiring this past year, I asked my GP if they had any ideas on which specialist I should approach, or any PM clinics they knew. To my complete surprise, my GP offered to see if she could take over my prescription. So, that is where my prescription now comes from, my GP. I go in every 3 mos, and occasionally they will urine test me, which I\u2019m happy to do.I\u2019ve been steady with my prescription for many years, and have been with my GP for several of those years. I think that\u2019s part of why my GP was willing to take a risk with me. Mostly, I feel like I just got unbelievably lucky.Of course, I know this isn\u2019t going to work for most people. But hopefully it can work for some of us. I\u2019m so grateful. It feels like it\u2019s being managed in a normal way, like anything other prescription.I\u2019m not suggesting everyone go to their GP and expect a prescription, unfortunately, that\u2019s sometimes seen (unfairly) as drug seeking.

But I have to say that in my area, most practices are interventional pain management or they are primarily interventional pain management, which means they don\u2019t give enough pain meds to adequately manage pain if you have a lot of pain. I was not given adequate pain medication when I was in pain management for a little more than a year and it was almost as bad as not having any medication. I only started to get adequate pain relief when palliative care took over, but I feel like I can\u2019t talk about that because not everyone can get palliative care and it\u2019s inconsistent among different practices. But I just wanted you to know that this is becoming all too common.But, I wouldn\u2019t give up. You have time to find a provider who will manage your pain medication. Use this time and make it a full time job to find another provider. I was dismissed by my palliative care provider in September and I was devastated at first and felt like there was nothing I could do. A couple of days later, I decided that I could find another provider. And I did. So have confidence during this time. Even though you likely don\u2019t feel very confident, fake it until you make it. You must.I wish you the best of luck. I don\u2019t mean to sound harsh, but I want to see you get another provider.

I went to a neurosurgeon who ordered imaging on my back AND neck. They found degenerated discs in my neck and pinched nerves in my back which all can be corrected. If this is not treated, this can cause permanent nerve damage and \"possible\" amputation (due to lack of sufficient blood circulation) and if not properly treated,  more invasive surgery would be coming up. I am scheduled for surgery to correct both areas. My advice, see a neurosurgeon (if you haven't already) and go from there. Save your appendages!",

For the first 5 yrs of marriage I made sure we attended (even if hubby dragged his feet) But, for 2 yrs I have missed weddings, birthdays, bar mitzvahs,bas mitzvah, and now chanukah. My in-laws are in their upper 80s and 90s. It's a 2 hour drive to get to them. My back cannot take 2 hours in a car most days, and yesterday I over did myself so no way I can do it. Tomorrow is a birthday party for a grandchild that I cared for when mom had a PPP event at 3 weeks. (I had her until she was 3 months) How do you all:Keep contact openAssure them it's not them your avoiding?I feel horrible!",

I can't really stand for more than maybe a minute without my pain rising and sitting for long periods of time also is an issue.I'm blessed to still be able to do one of my hobbies, archery. I do this out of a wheelchair also.There's this girl in the archery club that I find very cute and that I love to talk to. I've been wanting to ask her out for quite some time but I haven't had any ideas to which I would ask her out too.Without my pain I wouldn't have had a problem to ask her out. I would ask her out for coffee or something.But now I don't really know what to do.Does anybody have any ideas or even advice?(p.s. my confidence isn't really at an all time high due to my current situation.

If not I will name my firstborn after you.So there I am, in the ER because I dislocated my shoulder.  Regular Thursday for me but this one really fucked with me.  This doctor, who I love so much, instantly asked if I had seen a geneticist.  HELLO?Y'all don't understand (you ALL probably do) I have been asking my PCP for over half of my young life to figure out wtf was wrong with me.  Last few years has been spent asking to see a rheum and geneticist.  Sent me to one rheumatologist and I won't even get into the sins and atrocities of that hoe but when I said \"girlypop this is not it pls try again\" she said \"no \u2764\ufe0f sometimes we just never know\"WDYM WE JUST NEVER KNOW.  WE'RE GOING TO KNOW.  If it is genuinely so rare and never seen before name it after me bless \u2764\ufe0f whatever the case there will be a name.Anyways got my referral to a geneticist wish me luck",

Theres a lot of variants (13) of EDS, so you can probably explain even more symptoms. Not to alarm you or anything, but it can get quite serious. But its one of the things I believe they can test for and I'd sure ask about.I hate to see anyone put their hopes on the outcome of a single test. Most illness is like a big jigsaw puzzle with lots of pieces. Its hard to wish they find something. Please dont build those hopes too high. Simply having a finding on a genetic test doesnt necessarily mean its causing you \"the pain\" at this moment in time.  So please, temper those expectations, worst case, you wont be  disappointed. Good luck at the Geneticists...",

I fight through almost everything. I have always been a fighter but this time I\u2019m honestly feeling like this has messed me up in more ways than one. My pain management just increase my meds on my last visit. My pain has increased a lot in this past week. I finished my steroids and other meds I was released with hospital with. I will be seeing my PCP this week but I\u2019m not sure about anything at this point. I\u2019m so shaky and still out of breath when moving and talking. Like I talk for a living, when will all these different symptoms subside? Has anyone had this before? Any advice? When did you return back to somewhat normal? When did you return to work?",

My infection was so severe I had to go to out patient IV therapy every other day for 6 wks after discharge for antibiotics & they would give me a CAD-pump filled with my dose for the next day & my hubby would connect it to my midline IV since I couldn't reach it.

Most of the Kratom-related issues are MOLD related which would be gone if this were regulated.Kratom is an option but I'd leave it for a last option.As far as gaining weight... ENSURE! After I detoxed off of Kratom I still had 10% of my normal appetite. I STILL had to go to work. The docs suggested ENSURE and I can't recommend it higly enough. If you can get store-brand stuff it's cheaper but the same protein stuff in the end. Get the Signature branded (safeway/albertsons's) protein drinks. I suggest the green ones that have extra FIBER. Taking a 6-pack of those every DAY can help yoiu pack on the pounds.",

        "text": "I'm so glad I have a legal right to use Cannabis for my pain and mental health. I also fully support its use for others recreationally.That being said if you're a frequent user who smokes with neighbors close by use a sploof or look into better more efficient ways to consume your cannabis. Dry herb \"vapes\" or extraction devices work much more efficiently than smoking and put off almost no smell from a few feet away.Just because it's legal doesn't absolve us of our responsibility to use it responsibly, and it doesn't negate our friends, families, neighbors, and passerbys right to clean air. Here in CA (and many other states) you can end up with a lean on your home or owing money if you constantly smoke out your neighbors and they pursue legal action.I know I'd not appreciate someone chain smoking cigarettes upwind of my house constantly, and I'd feel the same if I had to smell weed constantly too. In our neighborhood a neighbor seems to do nothing but smoke Marley (cigar sized) sized joints about 8-10 times a day, about 15ft from his neighbors window. It literally stinks up the whole street. We've asked him to be considerate of the 2&8yo living next door and having to breathe his 2nd hand smoke constantly. He simply doesn't care and starts screaming it's legal. It was also legal when he was served papers for the lawsuit after 3yrs of trying to reason a certain neighbor had enough, even though that neighbor himself occasionally partakes responsibly away from his kids.Use your medicine responsibly if you're in close proximity to your neighbors. Don't be a jerk, modify your methods of consumption, in the end a dry herb vape will save you a lot of money by using less amounts of cannabis to get you equally medicated.",

I remember having lucid dreams when I told to myself \"Wait it doesn't hurt something's wrong !\" But I was extremely lucky to have very considerate parents (nurse and physiotherapist). I still feel that I was too protected though, which probably explains why I always craved independence and freedom.Most medication barely have any effect on my pain but ends up making me extremely hazy so I don't take anything right now.I have physio twice a week which helps a lot.I probably went crazy from excruciating pain at 12 with big femoral surgeries but now I'm 30 and completely independent. Sometimes the pain is too intense to move, or worst to focus. I those case I tend to take short naps, and have to work later sometimes.The thing that trouble me the most is when I have trouble to think straight, but having the healthiest diet and learning to manage stress helps. Pain is both from body and mind. You need to treat both at once. Some pain are purely physical and some are purely imagined (but they feel very real) but most are from both. I believe there's a lot of recent studies on neuro science on the topic.Pain = more stress / stress = more pain",

        "text": "I was first diagnosed with arthritis in my hip at 12yo. Constantly in pain since 10yo and throwing back ibuprofen everyday.Thankfully my mom was really supportive as she had the same issues as a kid which got much worse as she aged. By the time I was in kindergarten, she had to stop working and go on disability.So my mom took me to all sorts of doctors, trying to figure out what was causing my pain, not wanting me to end up like herself. No doctor had answers, just like how they never had answers for her after decades of complaints.I spent two years in non-stop physical therapy and everything just got worse, so they slapped an arthritis diagnosis on me and fired me as a patient, claiming they couldn't help. I spent the next 15 years complaining to various doctors who didn't believe me and only ever diagnosed me with anxiety. I lost hope that the medical system could help me, just like my mom did when she was trying to get help.My mom was the only one who believed me, so she kept me going mentally. As a teen I resigned to the fact that I'd be just like my mom, disabled in my 30s without answers. So I just kept throwing back ibuprofen, pushing thru everyday, until I was diagnosed with IBD at 27 (post covid) and a bunch of other symptoms popped up/worsened.I had to quit working and began applying for disability. I also started searching for answers on my own online. I was 28 when I discovered we actually have a genetic connective tissue disorder (hEDS) among other issues. Once I found these conditions online, it was surprisingly easy to get diagnosed because of how obvious it was. I just wonder why they were never suggested before... My issues are now significantly worse than my mother's when she was my age but at least we have answers as to why we're in pain.While I've embraced having my new doctors help treat me, my mom is still hesitant to find her own doctors (live in different states) due to a lifetime of being gaslit by doctors. I don't blame her. I get it. I'm still very on guard around doctors and it takesa lotto gain my trust. But it hurts seeing her trapped mentally like this and being unable to reach out for support/treatment.",

    "content": "Hiya! I've got EDS, Small fiber neuropathy, chronic migraines, fibromyalgia, and a general immunity to most medications. So I get to deal the old fashion way, even with the max dose of Cymbalta, gabapentin, rrazodone (for insomnia) and emgality fighting the good fight. Any recommendations on essential items to lessen pain? So far I haveCompression socks 140\u00b0 heated blanket and heating pad Compression gloves Hand warmers Knee braces and wrist braces Orthopedic shoe insertsI've got a back brace and shoulder brace on my to be gotten list (I've got scoliosis and my EDS makes me dislocate every other second).Any recommendations? I've been dealing for 6 years now but only started getting real diagnoses last year, so I guess I've finally come to terms with the fact that this is it. So bottom line is I'm willing to invest now on relief and aid, though it's still hard to view myself as needing it since I'm only 26. Should I get a cane? I don't always need it and there's usually a wall or a human to slump against if I start giving out. I haven't even started the disability process yet, even though I've been out of work a year.Anyways, any input from seasoned pain-havers is appreciated \u2661 (Thanks anyone who reads this for being here and you're doing a great job living!)",

    "content": "So, my hips are constantly unstable. At best, my right hip is impinged and my left hip has an anterior rotation, at worst I had between both hips, anterior rotation, posterior rotation, upslip, downslip, and a lateral rotation(?) as well as a few subluxations I finally got PT to acknowledge.On top of this, I have 7 herniated discs in my spine, the 2 in my lumbar are most problematic but occasionally my 4 in my C-spine and/or the 1 in my T-spine bother me. Most recently, I ended up in the ER last month as a result of PT apparently. I had left my PT session (different PT program, not the one I\u2019m in now) and 20 minutes later, both my legs dropped me and I felt a searing, shocking, electric pain at the same time. I had an excruciating 2 hour drive home that I was on the phone with 2 friends trying to make sure I got home okay and distracted me from the pain for a bit.I\u2019ve been out of work for 6 weeks now as a result of ending up in the ER last month. I got so close to getting proper care but my health insurance doesn\u2019t cover a lot including the treatment I need. It feels like such a joke, I\u2019ve lived at pain level 7 daily for 3 years, already had a dr tell me there\u2019s nothing that can be done as all spinal treatments worsened pain. Was just told earlier this month by a second physician there\u2019s nothing that can be done, I tried all the options short of surgery but I\u2019m not surgical.Trying to get anyone to take my disc herniations seriously is next to impossible. I had laminotomies on 2 levels (also have to argue about what surgery I had, I know -otomy vs -ectomy) but I also have a congenitally narrow spinal canal and I had surgery because my spinal cord was compressed to 7mm\u2026.normal is 15-27mm. At 7mm compression, I could still walk, stand, had full bowel/bladder control, just pain. I\u2019m not taken seriously because I don\u2019t lose bowel/bladder control, this last time my legs were affected so I was taken a little more seriously but still, they give me Tylenol (despite my allergy to it that \u201cisn\u2019t an allergy\u201d) and send me on my way.Anyway, looping back around, PT is telling me to walk intentionally to help strengthen the hip muscles to keep my hips in place\u2026.though allying and being upright hurts my back. My hips being out of place constantly is making my back pain worse. I\u2019ll be on visit 3/10 for PT next week\u2026PT noted my recovery chances are \u201cfair\u201d and I really don\u2019t know if that\u2019s good or bad anymore. I just can\u2019t stand the pain, I can\u2019t stand losing my mobility, I can\u2019t stand losing my ability to work, I can\u2019t stand losing my ability to drive. More so, I can\u2019t stand losing these abilities and being told I need to \u201cpreserve my mobility\u201d instead of drs helping me make my life more accessible rather than getting onto me for being in too much pain and too fatigued to get out of bed.",

The pt and exercise might be making you feel worse. If you are hyper mobile ( my child has EDS) you need to work with someone who can teach you how to stabilize your joints BEFORE attempting exercise or it will cause damage and pain. Keep making appointments and getting second and third opinions. Pain doesn\u2019t care how old you are and I\u2019m so tired of people saying \u201c you\u2019re too young to be in pain\u201d!!! Don\u2019t take no for an answer. Also, be careful when speaking to professionals. If you are too emotional you will not be heard and they will label you. Ask questions. Tell them how this pain impacts your day to day life. Don\u2019t let them label you with a mental illness ( unless you have one). This is real physical pain and they dropped the ball when it comes to your care. Get copies of your medical records and imaging. Read everything. Make appointments with the best doctors you can find.You were hit by a car! Do you have a lawyer? Can you sue?",

On good days, my pain is like white noise in my body that I can tune out because I'm used to it always being there. On bad days, I can't get out of bed.I don't know anything about hypermobility, unfortunately, and I'm sorry the adults and medical professionals in your life aren't supportive. Can you request a pain clinic (that's what it's called in the UK - it's for management of long-term pain) referral or go to someone who specialises in pelvic fractures/hEDS?For me, a lot of my pain is caused by anything that makes me unbalanced (so grocery shopping with a basket sets me off - but with a trolley I am okay) or sitting in an uncomfortable chair, overexerting myself or standing for long periods. I would recommend seeing if you can get a chair that supports your pelvis effectively, or a back support cushion. I have a very good memory foam back support cushion that is the only thing that gets me through the day at work.Don't be afraid to use mobility aids if you need them. When I fly I get assistance because I can't do that powerwalking across an airport to get to a gate in time, and it has been a game changer for travelling to be able to have someone wheel me. Before I used to have to schedule a day to recover at each end.I'm sorry you're going through this - it does suck. But your life isn't over and there are accommodations that can help you.I would also recommend any kind of topical pain relief gel - I use one with diclofenac on my hips when they are particularly tender and it's effective, I usually use it in bed when the pain is keeping me from sleeping.",

        "text": "Just wanted to add since I haven't seen it mentioned: definitely buy a heated blanket! You get the same amount of heat as a heating pad (in my opinion!) except it covers a MUCH larger area! It's an absolute godsend for me with my whole body muscle/joint/tendon pain. I hope it'll be helpful for you, too \u2764I'm sorry I can't offer much advice other than that since I, too, feel like doctors and their dismissals of me and my physical pain, and the mental/emotional pain that is caused from the physical pain, is driving me insane! Hopefully your parents can start advocating for you.Maybe another word of advice i haven't seen is: have you looked into hydro/aqua therapy? You might need a referral for that specifically, but if you can't get that or you would rather start with something smaller, you could always try finding a gym with one of those shallow and really warm pools. Obviously, to help joint instability, you have to build up the muscles around those joints, right? But that can be really difficult if major injury and/or prolonged inactivity have really weakened those same joints in the areas that have been injured, and it can make any sort of exercise/weight training/physical therapy very daunting and anxiety-inducing to even start up because of the risk of reinjuring those joints and just making things worse. BUT when you start in a pool, you eliminate all fall risk (you can't hurt yourself in a fall if you're just walking in the pool/swimming!), all exercise in it is super low impact on the joints, the water itself gives a lot of resistance even if you're just walking in laps around the shallow end so it's a great way to start building up some muscle, etc etc etc! There's a LOT of great benefits to exercise in pools! Maybe that'd be something worth looking into for you!!",

Unless you have any other issues like diabetes or something which can slow the healing.Have you worked on core muscles? A friend had a messed up lower half due to a dickhead driving into their car at high speeds. She was in pain. Had rods placed in bones to make sure they healed in the right place and then worked on building her core muscles and the pain eased. She still has aches every now and again but said she would gladly take that then the burning jolting pain she had in her hips, back and pelvis before.I really hope they can help you.

If you have ever seen \"It's A Wonderful Life,\" it deals with this, if not....simply put you have a massive impact on the world and people around you, if you know it or not. Taking that from the world is robbing it of all that you give to it, all the moments, people, places, and things you have an impact on, big or small. Also, we need you. Your experiences, your stories, your testimony, and your continued existence is an inspiration in and of itself and something I can point to when someone else feels like you do, and hopefully help them make the right choice not to quit as well. I literally launched Chronic Pain Warriors United after Friend, which helped me come up with the ideas and goals killed himself before launch. It is a major goal. We want to stop as many repeat of Friend as possible. And you, your story, and your experiences are something you can share with others in times of crisis, and in this way, many are saved who would otherwise be dead. It is worth it to keep going just for that! We all struggle every single day with the mental pain and isolation I posted about it yesterday. But you can use the situation and experience for the better and help others around you! We are here for you, too.https://youtu.be/73D4BPDBzxc?si=3JrbmE2QbDkX2c5q",

That can be quite comforting that even though you've not 'solved' your issues, the reminder to yourself that you don't need to carry all of that baggage at once - as well as the extra physiological baggage of all the catastrophic futures you may be conjuring up - and can be a starting point to cling onto and build from.Things can get better.....

I know there's anational suicide hotline & it could also provide some real support to you, also \ud83d\udc9cIt's a NIGHTMARE being a chronic pain patient and frankly, I don't judge you at all... However, we need you here. Your loved ones need you & so while we as chronic pain patients are forced to endure daily hell, I just want to ask you to please hang on.Also while it may sound cliche, leaning on the support you do have, like your dear friend & maybe even seeking therapy, could also really help. Thinking of you, please don't hesitate to reach out for any reason at any time :) Please take care.(By the way, if it's okay, I'll check on you in 24 hours - just want to make sure you're doing alright - so I'm going to add a Reddit bot reminder so I can check back in \ud83e\udec2 Remindme! 23 hours )",

I\u2019m reaching out to ask if anyone knows of a pain management doctor in the Washington, D.C. area who may take a more flexible approach to regulations surrounding pain management doses. My friend\u2019s mom had a failed back surgery over 20 years ago and has lived with debilitating pain ever since. She also suffers from spinal stenosis and degenerative disc disease. Recently , her doctors have reduced the pain medication she has been on for decades, leaving her to struggle to manage her pain. Any recommendations would be appreciated . Thank you !",

I live in FL though. I\u2019m finally lucky enough to have a wonderful GP though and when I told her what happened, she basically took me under her wing and took the role of being my pain doctor now. I\u2019ll tell you this, maybe try looking at family doctors too. They might be able to help, or atleast better refer you to PM. If anything, once she gets established they may be willing to help her get by until she can get to a PM appointment. But some GPs do play a pain doctor role as well.

Like everyone else here, I am subjected to urine screens on every visit, which is 28 days. I am currently prescribed Tylenol #4 (up to 5x per day) and I\u2019m also using a Butrans patch weekly 20 mcg. Per dose. Yesterday, I had my monthly visit and was informed that I tested positive for Hydrocodone. I do not use this medication as it I get strange reactions from it. I questioned the provider. She basically told me that the test was accurate and this was my first warning of three strikes that would get me expelled from this practice. I was in disbelief and couldn\u2019t think straight. I should have asked about the test and if there were positive results for codeine and buprenorphine. I told the practitioner that I could not have taken hydro and I have no access to it. She blew me off. I want to clear this up as I have been compliant as their patient since 2010. I\u2019m trying to find a way to rectify this and clear my name. I read somewhere that the metabolites in codeine can show up as hydro. I\u2019m furious because I always take my meds as directed and had clean urine screens. Any suggestions or feedback would be greatly appreciated.",

        "text": "OP here\u2026 So, I wanted to add something to this thread. I bought a hair drug test kit that will test for any drugs used in a 90 day period. This particular test indicates specific opioid medications such as hydrocodone, which is the medication that the PM lab said I had in my system. I did the test and I\u2019m waiting for the results. I know this may seem a bit extreme but my reputation as being a compliant patient is at stake and I resent the fact that i was given a warning for having hydrocodone show up in a urine test. I should get the results way before my next appointment. I\u2019m pretty certain Hydrocodone will be negative. I plan on taking the results with me to my appointment. If I am correct, and the lab made a mistake, how should I approach this with the practitioner? I don\u2019t want to come off as a cocky, confrontational patient. I simply want to point out the discrepancy and move on. Also, will the PM practitioner take a hair test for drugs seriously or will they blow me off again. I methodically took photos of every step of the testing process so there\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s my sample. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks and happy new year all.",

It\u2019s much easier to get a hold of a pack of cigarettes. I used to have grassdoor deliver them, but they went out of business.Those gummies are expensive af, a pack of American spirits are a better deal imho, because I doubt the gummies will be strong enough anyways, so smoking as a way to calm me down seem to be better.My pain management provider said that he wanted me to use MMJ only if I\u2019m going to be doing something productive/ active (not laying in bed), however when they did help they would incapacitated me. I\u2019m also heavily deconditioned to the point I frequently need to lay down during the day either from pain, high blood pressure, faitigue or concentration faitigue. This excludes any mental health need to lay down.Due to the psychoactive effects of THC and other chemicals in MMJ that we are still learning about, it may not be the best option for a person who has psychiatric conditions like people have Pok\u00e9mon cards.It is currently a scheduled substance where I live, and frankly I\u2019m tired of having to take various scheduled substances to function and thus having ludicrous amounts of regulations that dictate and take away from the freedom we had prior to needing to take them for our health.Does any of this resonate with others, or am I just being overly cranky about being 90 at 30 (since nobody is willing to recognize that sometimes people my age got the shit end of the stick and no matter how much you say \u201cYou are too young to be this disabled/ in this much pain.\u201d My medical conditions don\u2019t seem to get the memo and leave me alone.",
