I had to stop going due to scheduling issues in October (I’m in school full time, two days a week I do teaching practicum, and I’m a solo parent) and now I’m having new symptoms. I was getting injections for migraines and neck pain, never had issues…all of a sudden I have a sternum-clavical issue, the whole right side of my body feels odd - numb, hypersensitive, lightening pain - randomly. I find my balance is a bit off too. I have an appointment with my primary care doctor in the new year. I am so tired of new symptoms popping up. This is the third time in the last few years I’ve randomly had new, painful and disruptive things start to happen. Anyone else relate? I have no one IRL I can talk to about this",

        "text": "I’m in the exact same boat as you. For me heat on my back helps the pain so I’d recommend getting some heat patches likethese. They make some for the back but if you can’t find those they also have some for menstrual cramps but I think they can work pretty well for back pain too. You could get a back brace but doctors usually don’t like when you wear them too often as it can weaken the muscles in the area. I’d suggest consulting with your doctor beforehand to see how often is safe and which ones would work best for you. If the pain also is in your hips and gives you trouble walking a cane might be a good idea. When walking long distances I’d try to get all through an area that has lots of benches or seating in case you need to take a break. I wish you the best and hope you know pain is never “too little to manage”. Any pain isn’t what most people have to go through and there is no “threshold” for help.",

Obviously I know that’s not going to cure it but warming up and relaxing the muscles can help with some of the pain, as well releasing endorphins from exercising or helping to feel more relaxed from stretching. Plus it’s just good for you in general. Just take it easy and slowly start to find stuff you can do without worsening your pain.",

        "text": "My personal opinion is that Ketamine is under-utilized specifically for pain control. It is highly effective as an anesthetic and avoids more difficult problems from long term opioid use. But, I’m more curious as to what doctor you have prescribing for chronic pain. The off label use is for psychiatric treatment, not pain. I’ve been on the daily low dose from Joyous. It’s not perfect, but works for me for pain management and the anxiety & depression aspect of having headache and neck disk bulge for 20 yrs. I’m now off opioids and I’m considering increasing my dosages as the ketamine does indeed help for pain.",

More than just reduce pain, my philosophy is trying to retrain my brain via neuroplasticity. Ketamine allows you brain to create new neuropathways. If your brain has a deeply rooted pain pathway, ketamine can help to create new pathways, different ones. So deep meditation and mindfulness while dosing ketamine. Good luck my friend.",

I also had/have twitching/muscle spasms everywhere, mainly in my legs, but even my face twitches at times, literally everywhere. I have severe neck and back pain (started after chiro in Sept, never ever again), pain under my armpits, traps/shoulders, and frequent headaches. Every morning I wake up with pain in my forearms, shoulders/traps area, and legs. It's like crampy/achy pain. Because every test came back normal, doctor diagnosed fibromyalgia. We've already tried cymbalta, gabapentin, and amitriptyline to no avail. Said they can't really help me further. Went to a neurologist, got a steroid pack and prescribed PT (4 weeks in) by neuro and PM back doctor, awaiting an EMG also. Nothing helps. Tylenol, ibuprofen, etc., has not helped. I am in so much pain I'm bed ridden most of the day some days. I don't know what to do. My body aches as if I have the flu. I feel sick and so unwell. They essentially said there's nothing more they can do and I'm just laying in bed suffering. I'm a mom and I can't even do that efficiently right now I need so much help from family. It sucks. I want to be normal again.",

I have had it for 26 years and I have managed to marry, have babies and keep my full time jobs. You need to try and find the right medication for yourself and therapies. I know that there is also Savella out there for fibro. I also do acupuncture, and massage therapy and see a psychiatrist for my mental health. I find this probably the most important as I am able to cry, grieve and express my emotions about fibro in a safe space. My psychiatrist has chronic pain too so that helps and there are times we laugh our heads off at the things that happen in our lives. But, please don’t give up as I know you will find your way! Reach out to family and friends when you need help. Look into mindfulness and meditation. It can be helpful to get you out of some dark places when you have a flare. Just be patient with yourself and your body. It will be an adjustment to yourself, friends and family but you will get there! Slowly but surely you will find the right balance and be able to live with this disease. If you have any direct questions or just need to vent please reach out to me in a DM. I will be more than happy to listen and help! 😊❤️",

I became septic and almost died after being denied medically necessary abortion in 3 different hospitals over a 6 week period.

        "text": "It’s the disconnect that drove me crazy.I mean, here’s the thing.  “Normal” people, the ones in the middle of the Bell curve, that have developed some ouchies over the course of life, in part because of repetitively using muscles incorrectly with poor posture … yeah, IF they have a good teacher, and IF they are capable of correcting some issues … yoga and mindfulness are the absolute best things they can do to improve their lives.We, however, are the chronically pained.  We exist on the ends on the Bell curve.  It is safe to say, for the vast majority of us, how we use muscles and our posture has been significantly fucked over years of pain, PLUS the mental triggers that wreak havoc on our nervous systems, make mindfulness quite difficult, even impossible.  To “properly” mindfully use some muscles is cognitively equivalent to asking a color blind individual to be mindful of the differences between red and green.[I can’t just complain without also adding my own advice which might actually help 10-30% of those here, which mean, I too, am pissing off up to 90% of us, lol]I know longer have my wits (lost them a good 20 years ago).  Here is the best I can offer along Yoga lines and mindfulness:  Invent yoga.Discover mindfulness by noticing the difference in how you move, breathe, whatever … with a change in mediums.  Got a PT exercise that hurts like fuck and you gave up on after a few days?  Do a half a set, then try again displaced in water (pool or hot tub) and notice differences, likely not where you expect.  Maybe try it after eating a half dose of a marijuana edible.  Those differences you may notice can set you on a path to understand problems you may have (example, like how to fight gravity itself you may overcompensate in some ways that make the PT you were advised impossible).Sorry to ramble and offer my own “ridiculous for most” advice, but maybe this helps just one person.  That’d be kinda cool.",

I don’t do crawl (hypermobility, it practically unscrews my arms and they dislocate), but if I do breaststroke for an extended period, 20 minutes to an hour+, I can afterwards do some butterfly, lol.  People freak out when they see me do butterfly after a crazy slow breaststroke, not to mention difficulty walking when out of the pool, lol.  It makes so little sense.Personally, I rec anything in water that allows some core work, and build from there.  Most important is to not give a shit how silly or ridiculous it may look (and that can be really hard for people to overcome).  Once your core gets a little strength, other parts can get a little better over time.I am so big on getting in water, and I specifically try to avoid using the word “swimming.”  Just like a person saying do yoga, the way we broken move is not likely to fit with their definitions, if that makes sense.",

She says that I should just take paracetamo and be on a pain patch.I'm only taking my dihydrocodeine as prescribed for my slipped discs and painful bladder syndrome. I'm in agony because I'm going into withdrawals and she's only giving me like a couple of pills to last the day, which is a quarter of my normal dose.My pain is normally severe but I had got into a good routine with taking dihydrocodeine before the pain gets bad and using my pregabalin as normal for the nerve pain.Anyone have any idea what I should do? I'm seeing the doctor tomorrow. My mum wanted to come with me but I told her I'm not consenting to that. My body, my pain, my choice.UPDATE: Thanks for all the advice guys, I'm not calling the police om my mum BUT I will speak about it with my doctor. Also she managed to *loose' about 75% of the pills last night when she was drinking some wine ugh 😫",

The law is completely different to the US, yeh she might get arrested and given a talking to but if the police went to the cps who decide whether they will prosecute they'd very likely say no because they're not guaranteed to get a conviction... They won't spend the money if they don't feel sure they'll get the person convicted.I know someone who was arrested for manslaughter, he'd hit a bloke who had tried to lure his kid (we later found out he was a convicted paedophile), anyway the next day the bloke was found dead in another area of the city. He died of a head injury and they wanted to pin it on someone, witnesses saw the bloke I know hit him so the police decided he was the culprit. Then it came out he'd had a full blown fight with someone in the house he'd been found outside... But nobody would give names so the police persisted to try and pin it on (we'll call him Bob) because they needed to look liek they actually gave a shit.. Which I doubt they did considering the dead man had messed with his 7 year old daughter!This dragged on for months, caused Bob no end of trouble.. He'd been labelled a fucking murderer. Eventually he got a parcel form the police with his clothes in that they'd taken, his phone and a letter saying the cps weren't taking it further due to lack of evidence and the fact they probably wouldn't get a conviction from a jury if he pleaded not guilty.That's someone dead and nobody went to prison, they're not going to prosecute a mother who in her eyes is trying to protect her daughter. Whuek I totally disagree and think she is completely in the wrong, it's not something she would go to prison for in the UK.",

This is why I work with my medical team to make sure that I am taking advantage of every opportunity and treatment necessary, and that includes my meds.You are not a member of my medical team. You are my mother. You can have beliefs. You can have opinions. You can have desires. You do not get to ACT on them. They are anxieties for you to address with YOUR relevant mental health support. You can believe a surgery is too dangerous. You can have the opinion that the success rate is too low. You can even tell me you don't want me to have it. But you can't stop it if my medical team and I decide that's the route we're going to go. You simply don't have that authority. Nor do you get to ok my meds.So, I've indulged this for a bit, and that was likely a mistake. I'm sorry for doing that. I should never have allowed you to think I would tolerate you exercising a veto over any of my medical needs. It's not happening.So! Where we are now is I am instructing you to go and get my pills from wherever you've squirreled them and to return all of them to my control. That's not negotiable.IF YOU DO NOT, I will be calling law enforcement and reporting the theft of a controlled medication. The only thing they will care about is whose name is on the bottle. The only person allowed to have those pills in their control is the person  to whom they've been prescribed. They might believe you that you took them away from me for what you mistakenly believed was my own good. If you apologize profusely enough and the pill count adds up to what it should, they may even just write the whole thing off with a stern warning that you're not to do this again.But then the whole reason you're acting like this is because of the opiate crisis. The opiate crisis ALSO means that any cop that shows up will have seen plenty of cute little middle-aged ladies who swear up and down the reason they have so many bottles of other people's scheduled substances is because they're totally not the junkie.So, any way we do this, I end up with my pills back. Either privately and quietly right now, no harm, no foul. We never have to speak of it again. OR it happens anyway, and you're either called an idiot by a police officer who is deeply annoyed you made him do this, OR get a criminal record for being illegally in possession of a schedule drug you don't have a prescription for.",

Basically means if youve been living there and your stuff is there she can't put you out (although once you leave she could have the locks changed).

I am in the US and I can tell you're not based on the medication you're taking as we don't have that here so I'm not sure about laws there vs here but I would probably call the police or tell your mother that you will call the police for taking your legally prescribed medication away from you. Idk about there but it is illegal here for her to have possession of it. Also, this is completely beside the point bc I don't think you're addicted but I would personally tell my mom if her concern was an addiction than this is def not the appropriate way to handle this. Forcing someone in chronic pain into withdrawal is def not a way to get them off narcotics. As someone who has interstitial cystitis which I believe may be painful bladder syndrome in the UK, your mom can fuck right off. I am so sorry you're going through this. It's an extremely painful condition. I also have back issues and failed spinal fusion. It's miserable. Idk about the medical field where you are but would calling your doctor be an option? It would absolutely not be here as they would immediately assume drug seeking or something. I'm just trying to think of any possible option bc you absolutely should not be suffering like this. And also, I'm sure you know this goes without saying but I would strongly advise you find somewhere else to live. I know it's tough with finances but your mother will do this again unfortunately.",

Some may say she needs to know because you live there so she could watch for side effects, etc.  I say she's lost that privilege. She can watch for side effects without knowing what meds you're on.

Maybe it would be a good idea to have your mom go to the appointment so your doctor could explain to her that you’re not addicted and you’re prescribed for a reason. Also let her know that you’ve been taking your medication as prescribed and if she doesn’t let you take them you will go through withdrawal. I think you already mentioned that. I’m so sorry if you’re going through withdrawal. You have to get your medication back from your mom. I’m assuming you’re over 18 so it’s really ridiculous that your mom is trying to control your medication. You literally have chronic pain and a doctor is prescribing you, it’s not like you’re getting stuff from the streets or using hard drugs.

Opiate withdrawal is fucking serious and horrible (I have flashbacks from withdrawals) and I will take anything to stop the feeling, I have actually tried getting heroin in its place before out of fear of the withdrawal.I've got knackered discs and have on, off severe sciatica... That pain is in a league of it's own! I've birthed 3 babies and at times I'd happily take all 3 at once over sciatica pain. And my daughter has Interstitial cystitis and I've witnessed the pain she suffers, I couldn't possibly imagine taking her painkillers away, I wouldn't care if she so addicted she was stealing to get the meds, if it eases her pain I'll do the fucking stealing for her! I'm shocked that any mother would want to see their child suffering, especially with the pain you have. I've seen my daughter curled up in a ball crying in agony, scared to stand up because the pressure is so great she feels like her pelvis will explode... Imo the term painful bladder syndrome is a piss take because it's a lot more than fucking painful. She also has to self catheterise 4 times a day which itself is painful especially with Interstitial cystitis because her bladder spasms and she can't get the catheter back out.Your mum is being fucking selfish (apart from breaking the law, taking dihydrocodeine is theft of a class B drug and she's I'm possession of that drug without a prescription... She's causing you direct harm), she's not thinking of you just herself and while I would suggest you at least threaten her with the police, even if it's to make damn sure she sees how serious this is, I would say that you should definitely tell your dr she's stealing your medication. And I'd also consider finding somewhere else to live.Personally I'd rather live on the breadline eating porridge every day than live with someone as controlling and selfish as your mother.Edit... I didn't read the last sentence... She's taking your much needed pain meds away cis she disagrees with you taking them, but she's getting so drunk she lost YOUR meds? She's a fucking hypocrite.",

Also, if she has them on her or is taking them and gets caught, you could face criminal charges yourself.Editing to add: your mother didn’t “lose” 75% of your pills by drinking wine. Why was she opening your bottle to lose them? She stole your medication and is using them, which you will be removed from your pain program if you do not report.

I would if I were you have a personal medicine safe for your medication from now on, and start setting boundaries regarding your meds and anything else that your Mum oversteps with. Communication is key, and your Mum should be able to understand with your explanation why you need your medication, should be able to explain why she is fearful you’re addicted and then a discussion should take place. Find statistics on opioid addictions and how long they take to form and explain to her how you feel when you take it.For example, I take the lowest dose possible when I can and can change from taking 6 a day to 3 a day based on my pain. I don’t get any mood changes or cravings, no bad moods when I don’t take it and I don’t feel the need to over medicate. That’s how I explain to doctors that I’m not addicted, so maybe just share with your Mum in an honest convo.I have to admit it might be an idea that if she does it again, take her to the doctor appointment with you but pre-warn the doctor that she needs the appointment to understand your condition, pain and medication.

He wanted to make sure everyone was taken care of and he did a lot of missionary work overseas and never did anything wrong but still ended up with stage four colon cancer. I'm so mad.

My OH goes oh you'll need to be really gentle with her as she has a low pain threshold. Her 7 is probably my 3.I didn't say anything.At the end of the session the guy turned round and said if anything her 3 is your 9.Apparently my other half hadn't quite realised how pain thresholds work. Sure I complain about pain when I'm at home, but that's because I've spent all day at work masking it - it's not because I have a low pain threshold. I'm just letting my barriers down a bit.",

I barely use pain meds and I didn’t request refills at my last 90 day appt because I thought I was fine with what I had.  I knew the nurse thought I was a junkie who downed them all. My dinky home meds couldn’t touch it anyway even if I did have them, and the thought of no one being able to help me just broke me. I just quietly cried that i wasn’t looking for a prescription and just needed anything to help get it down. Luckily I ended up with a kind doctor who got me a steroid shot, torodol, a dose of pain meds and muscle relaxers. By the time she saw me I was unable to focus or process conversations, my BP was high and I was trembling. She let me stay in a quiet room for over an hour until my pain level came down. I was so grateful she helped me.We get so used to having to hold it together that we don’t “look” that bad. Sometimes I wish I had it in me to just lose control like “normal” people do, but my pain reflex is silence. I don’t want to move, talk or have any kind of stimulus. I just want the world to stop while I try to breathe thru it because crying makes it worse. Sometimes it think we need medical bracelets to say if I’m here at the hospital and I seem relatively fine, I’m not.",

I don't start crying until an 8, and I never say my pain is higher than a 9.5 because I imagine being run over by an 18-wheeler would be a 10.\"This has changed over the years, especially after multiple failed surgeries. I used to cry at a 5.Now I'm working out most days because I'm finally not mostly bedridden and if I don't get strong I get more injured. So I'm swimming 3x/week, personal trainer 2x/week, plus PT. Every workout makes my pain a 7 for the rest of the day, and then it settles back to a normal 6 over night.I explain this to my doctors and they are \"proud of me\" and \"happy with that level of pain based for my condition.\" Every time I hear this my brain can't fathom it. I just think if that doctor saw a diabetic patient that said their insulin success rate was on that scale they'd be helped.But pain patients are just supposed to deal. And I'm not even talking about medicating us, I'm just saying, can't they acknowledge the pain and then at least feign compassion.Oof. Sorry for the rant. I just needed someone to listen today. Thanks, and I wish you all at least a few calmer minutes today.",

I think not being able to work is a big part of my problem.But, importantly, I'm really glad you and your doctor aren't done working on how to get your pain lower.Edit: My least favorite issue that doctors have is regarding addiction. Yes, addiction (whether physical or mental) is going to be an issue. Yes, you will have to taper down and not force someone to stop cold turkey. But you know what else, my antidepressants can't be stopped instantly and I'm physically addicted to those. People's insulin can't just be taken away. Because what can people do if they're in so much pain they can't function, but doctors won't help with medication when needed? They're going to drink, find drugs, self-harm, and kill themselves.

My husband jokes that its because i have control issues, but he may be right.  I dont like not being in control of my own body and mind.    I can understand how some people could abuse the drugs, but not an issue for me.  Unfortunately, people act like anyone taking these is an addict and the pills are evil. They are prescribed for a reason: they work!  I take them as prescribed, and i am drug tested every month.  I just wish people would realize that they aren't bad.  I actually had to leave my latest neurologist because she didn't believe in opioids, and was pissed that i chose to go into pain management.",

What a lot of people don’t realize their first time, and we weren’t told, is that you are required to stand for a long time for a safety drill right as the ship leaves, typically 30-40 minutes crammed in with other people while they do a head count. We had just gotten married so I was still in my dress and a small heel. After that I physically couldn’t walk for 2 days.Now we know to muster in the disabled section and I always get a side eye when we ask. I always want to flip everyone off when we walk in- they have no idea who has what conditions. You absolutely made the right call to ask and advocate for yourself and your needs.

        "text": "Wow very well said.  Ive seen wo many people whether it be in the emergency room or in my doctors office(they have thin walls) say their pain is a 10 out of 10 when asked and are cracking jokes or talking on the phone. That makes doctors dismiss the pain scale in my opinion. I am honest and mine averages around a 4 to 6 with meds and 7 or higher at times without. Im not gonna try to exaggerate to tell the Dr. What I think he wants to hear.  But that is a very good quote nonetheless 👌",

The situation was made worse because the doctor that was originally treating me, and who did botched surgery on me, turned on me and wouldn’t help me. So even when I saw other doctors, they were indifferent or said I should go back to him.In the meantime, the stress of the pain was killing me. TW: suicide/death/medical issuesI’d frequently have stress induced seizures which caused some really nasty falls/head injuries. I’d throw up and black out and wake up choking on vomit. I weighed 93 lbs. and was still dropping and had significant heart issues. I was surprisingly not suicidal (I’m terrified of death, or else I would’ve been), but I had written a letter to my parents convinced this would be the end of me.Eventually, they had no choice but to admit me to the hospital for this. I told them if they discharged me without pain management, I would die. I was finally, begrudgingly, put back on PM.I spoke to a lawyer, but didn’t get very far. It probably didn’t help that I was so, so weak. I didn’t find others outside my parents very sympathetic. I ended up with severe PTSD.",

        "text": "“The clinic argued Slone’s pain doctors were trying to responsibly treat a patient who was at a precarious moment, one whose suicide was entirely unforeseen. Slone had been placed on “an astronomically high dose” of opioids by other clinicians when he was at a nursing facility recovering from surgery. His pain physicians then lowered his dose to one that he had previously been on. And when he misused that prescription, burning through it too fast, they had no choice but to deny a refill until his appointment.”Enraging! They make it sound like he was popping pills to get high or something. When in reality these were the desperate actions of a man in excruciating pain that had his pain medication dosage slashed by over 50%. Anyone with a lick of pharmacology knowledge knows that you have to taper any drastic decrease in opioid pain medication. You can’t cut someone’s medication by more than half and expect them to function as well as they did before. The abject cruelty and indifference shown to this poor man by his clinic is sadly only the tip of the iceberg. Many chronic pain patients have been treated similarly, and many of them also have died by suicide.The DEA, PROP, the CDC and many more have a lot to answer for and atone for. The misapplication of the 2016 “guidelines” ,which were taken as gospel by prescribers, was the catalyst to this insane misdirection and inhumane treatment. It’s time for common sense to return to pain management. My thoughts are with all the victims of this madness.",

        "text": "“As a result, U.S. opioid prescribing has plummeted in the past decade, even as the overdose crisis has reached record heights due to an explosion of illicit fentanyl.”Gee, I wonder why that is? Could it be thatthese two groups of people are not the same?!We don’t use illicit fentanyl, we take our prescribed medications like we are supposed to in order to eke out as much normalcy as possible. We aren’t trying to ride the H train to oblivion, we are just trying to live our lives like the rest of the world.It’s only when we are denied the tools to live normal lives do we take drastic measures like taking the “emergency exit” and looking to unconventional sources. And who drives folks to that? The same ones complaining about the very problemtheycreated.I am really super pleased this woman won her suit. Good on her for going after the people who essentially killed her spouse through medical neglect. It’s tragic this happened to her family and I hope doctors, insurance companies, pharmacists, any anyone in a position of power in the medical field sees this and thinks twice before doling out unnecessary pain and harm to someone in need like he was.",

They especially don’t once your receptors have adjusted and you have a tolerance. The IV fentanyl I mentioned just felt calming and relieved the pain I was in. No euphoria.

That dosage was determined to be the lowest effective dose for me by me and my Kaiser doctor many many years ago. And that was done after I went through every kind of hoop offered to me.Fast-forward to just before the new guidelines came out three years ago or whenever it was. My condition got gradually worse over all those years. I was finding it more and more difficult to do the things that I was already limited in doing. I was about to have a talk with my doctor about raising my dosage to 50 mg a day.Then the guidelines came out and I got my phone call . Kaiser purposely misinterpreted the guidelines. No one can tell me everyone at Kaiser. Is that stupid. They did it to cover their asses. There are some articles around here about the back room deals that Kaiser made with drug manufacturers.So now I am not able to see my grandkids as often as I’d like to not even close. I’m not able to even go for a walk every night which I was able to do before. I have to consider how much pain I’m gonna be in just to get up and do something. I have to screw up my courage just to go down the hallway to the bathroom. This is absolutely ridiculous.But hey, I can just go get another doctor outside Kaiser, right ? I’m sure that’ll be a breeze to find a doctor who’s taking new patients and who is willing to treat new patients with opioids and who takes Medicare and who takes Medicaid.So I’m just in this holding pattern of hating life or what equates to it these days. How can doctors and other health ‘care’ providers who do this to people look at themselves in the mirror every day.It’s unconscionable the way CPP are treated in this country.",

It took its toll on me. So, so sad. Godspeed researchers that are working on non-opiate pain relief methods.

As I’m still surrounded by people who act like opiates are evil incarnate, and only think of them in relation to drugs, addiction, and death by overdose, I’m glad to see that’s not how everyone sees them. I’ve had family accuse me of being an addict and doctor shopping until I “found one willing to give me a diagnosis I didn’t have for drugs I didn’t need”. The addiction treatment clinic keeping me ON pain meds has helped that somewhat, now there are fewer who don’t believe me. But there’s still a few who refuse to accept my diagnosis and the pain that comes with it. But that could also be because my diagnosis is genetic and they don’t want to believe that it could also be affecting them or their kids. Not my problem though.
