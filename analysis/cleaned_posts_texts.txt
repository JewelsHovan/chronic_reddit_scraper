directed shut due stupidness bit like car insurance right people make bogus claim time everyone pay price premium dont give research option recently dropped oxycodone usage using suboxone given ketamine lozenge breakthrough pain work way better oxys ever perfect response wanted try ketamine pain dont fund moment wasnt even majority doctor prescribing pill mill operating drug dealer giving

make sleepy lozenge better iv used receive ketamine infusion really hated getting pain relief didnt last long wasnt bigger issue perdu pharma missled medical professional patient risk level addictiveness oxy posed propaganda worked think well get addicted overdose disheartening never ever felt need med take prescribed never requested mg nothing much lose become addict know addiction hard u shouldnt labeled way keep getting voted everywhere say ive taken tramadol everyday multiple dos month withdrawal stophow addiction thing happens become unhappy back hurt thats addiction love addiction there lot great reason aside opioid crisis provider want prescribe opioids said pain management specialist ask primary care refer one treat opioids differently able help get getting appropriate transition different regimen help people recent study cast doubt upon long term effectiveness painkiller thought effective short term like break arm adverse effect upon nervous system insular cortexim path withdrawal year opioids cause poor gut transit expert chronic pain treatment often seem detrimental relationship mental health much pain itselfmedical knowledge change make choice work push back doctor year ago pushing corpse wheelbarrow fresher prank dont know everythingmerry christmas like dad gun pulled violentthreatening act get opioids promethazine pharmacysome nice people targeted pharmacy hospital effort obtain drugit suck affected usit sucked healthcare worker faced life danger drug opioids primarily stigmatised opioid crisis big pharma getting people hooked profit show like dope sick really shone light behaviorbut also opioids create addiction addiction change brain creates dependency impact user long term negative way change way produce dopamine put another way find happinessif someone need opioid manage pain access end story trade subsequent addiction harm every day life relationship etc necessary evil many recommend looking doctor patient forum sure im allowed leave link ever heard remember red traffic light green one believe could similar factor herethere unfortunate patient get highly dependent psychologically broken tolerance hyperalgesie even misuse happens understandable desperation psychologically patient often suffer isolation unfair life general patient get lost pain doc go retirement get kicked one place another already saw case like time cant help get shock pure empathy human nothing wrong still suffer pain also psychologically endure drastic measure like withdrawing opioids even though obviously would need themand think medical people tend remember patient one simply work might fall mental gymnastics trap must patient fault someone else seen sooner might thinkand consequence patient seems work great moment feel lingering fear eye medical staff fear might go wrong like end absolute hell fast endurable way backi feel like good pain doc fear well work hard thinking scientifically driven memory emotion concentrating hell patient endure right mostly bc people overuse many doctor assume everyone become way there also concern stopping ppl automatically go street alternative much deadly due substance theyre often laced wish would realize continue prescribe opioids work chronic pain people rarely need go street story ive heard ppl turning street drug pain relief start doctor unwilling continue treatment plan work know opioid crisis caused stigma still doesnt make sense plus lot primary care doctor still dont much experience prescribing med long term use know learned med school story theyve heard dont realize common think read quote recently said withholding opioids people truly need bc ppl overused like withholding water people bc people drown also lot study show opioids cause severe gi dysmotility ive learned doesnt happen everyone really isnt common believe especially chronic pain patient lot stigma mostly apply shortterm opioid use like surgery ppl dont understand severe gastroparesis intestinal dysmotility due ed type diabetes palliative care year old im tpniv fluidsiv zofran benadryl q take high dose oxy q ileostomy losing colon part small intestine ileostomy output still high need additional prescription med slow output since otc med dont help im explaining prove oxy yet slow whats left gi tract even tho there still assumption slows everything everyone know people experience side effect doctor dont understand doesnt happen everybody dont much experience long term use opioids ive even told opioids make pain worse also doesnt make sense silly deny opioids truly working compliant bc doctor still free say ppl ask get early refill continue prescribe le ppl need turn street drug get slightly improved quality life oxy brings pain grateful bc thing worked thats tolerant pain level ive expressed doctor im realistically never expected painfree need little le pain function hope able find doctor willing continue prescribe since worked past addict held accountable action get blamed used get high mean everyone alcohol ok also joke ive someone tell oding real fent good time try itidk widespread phenomenon population people see taking dos drug get od goal accident seems like extreme kind extreme alcohol addictive acceptable medical use addiction potential thats true opioids high addiction potential overshot mark addressing people pain need cant access qol take nosedive week jaw surgery literally begging cry extremely addictive even dont need anymore feel like youre going die without cry jaw still hurt thats valid opiate impact brain chemistry impact doesnt necessarily go away stop taking medication pain impact brain chemistry feel like pretty much went back baseline discontinuing opiate every time discontinued opiatesafter discontinuing dopamine blocking agent though stuck around long timeforever change even discontinuing corticosteroid ill never able see like taking fentanyl alcohol fine

overwhelmed pain also started alot diarrhea tmii mean pain bad started wanting die way could wait next appointment dec th really nervous message drug test thing featured previous postslong story short last drug screen one didnt morphine next time oxycodone im still completely baffled take medicine like clockworkanyway give take chance message tuesday explained everything going fentanyl didnt hear anything back tuesday finally got message wednesday evening closedthey told went one office waste fentanyl patch theyd switch back morphine regular office hour away closed thursday friday went another office hour worth different directioni opened wasted aka cut put kind special container curious said technically medicine one dispose itby time got home got call saying sent morphine er prescription ive never life happy see bottle morphineanyone else think fentanyl suck experience interesting see various medication metabolized different patientsim complete opposite morphine useless pain make incredibly itchy patch work like charm take care poorly fentanyl patch think wasnt getting full dose patch isnt completely stuck dont andor body didnt process well get sweaty patch raise cant fully restuck even tegaderm often great fit ambulatory patientsi couldnt even get patch last hour withdrawal increased pain every day plus got horrid raised red itchy rash even steroid nasal spray area first allow dry applying patch tegaderm fear patch releasing much med get hot like long shower fevernote doctor typically reduce dose converting another opioid patient often dont complete crosstolerance willing stick likely would willing increase dose may stopped mild withdrawal got better pain reliefeveryone responds differently med started methadone pain doctor assumed id option literally tried happily circled back methadone increased pain andor withdrawal every one even dose increasethere many option beyond morphine fentanyl morphine isnt ideal youre trying something else u id check insurance cover require prior authorization formulary bring list pain doctor discus sound like may opioid withdrawal fentanyl anxiety diarrhoea increased painit could low dose compared morphine milligram equivalent mme taking prescribed morphine eryes much possible strong opioid like fentanyl however im really glad youre back medication working want switch first placealso regarding drug test sample sent lab simple urine cupdip stick reason cheap urine cup drug test well known unreliable doctor manage issue sending positive sample confirmatory lab testing much accurate reliable pm lab depth testing insanely detailedi wanted switch pain starting increasesame dose morphine oxycodone year didnt realize pain well managed wasnt plain simple ungrateful wonder morphine oxycodone thought well guess could feel bettermake mistake im still pain manageable level im relieved think much pain im relieved feel normal exactly said definitely going withdrawal imagine cut op medsthey would go insane sound bad make fear worry ive withdrawal med strong theyre taking man put feedle position sweat diarrhea like said whole body pain anxiety ugh suck bad ive taken opioids surgery post op pain ive push fentanyl right surgery didnt touch pain suck bad feel like sugar pill almost absolutely nothing pain via iv mcg percocet worked better iti think liver enzyme different people body doctor dont research far ive disappointed ward setting ive twice emergency transport complete blackout great stuff everything id authorised inpatient failed team leader assessed tear pain genuine phoned authority fentanyl injection relieved made difference knock flat hate stuff curiously side effect sound like withdrawal dosage patch thought mcg patch exact dose equivalent daily morphine withdrawal fentanyl withdrawal heroin hell going didnt give enough time get used medicine may missing best relief many mcg thing need change patch every day since otherwise youll pain flareups since really technically last hour youll notice better pain relief way also need take oxycodone type breakthrough since fentanyl long lasting drug instant relief ordeal use patch likely wont enough truly think gi symptom would either pas unrelated body need adjust new med since chance im saying since literally night day practically changed life since could barely stand stuck bed effective im like pain versus like pain every single person different course maybe wasnt right remember almost ripping twice since made feel weird also like appetite friend started around time gi issue first said diarrhea

opiatesopiods tried hold long could beginning get suicidal pain unfortunatefentanyl wonder pt first got crp got easily put first neurosurgery mcg radiation mcg nd neurosurgery helped immensely addition mg oxy breakthrough pain day discharge told going send prescription mcg one day body fighting back felt like going die took called say wanted go mcg day hospital stay made miss dose long

demonize everything related subject based couple incident aunt disability right activist staunchly think itll lead genocide disabled peoplesomeone sub said dr family pushing assisted suicide canada even tho clear currently option mindi think legal terminal case disease course treatment relief treatment worsen pain time decision patient dr cannot even recommend along available mental health crisis mandatory therapy multiple drs ensure forced someone else rash decision based situational depressionbut really thing america imagine would implement protection therapy nothing end ending

doormake opioid pain med available everyone need let rational conversation maid humble opinionchronic pain patient deserve dignity treatment everyone deserves way think wellfounded slippery slope argument expert im guessing might something fear doctor giving little help chronic illness especially suffered woman dismissed hysteria anxiety allowing assisted death might add apathy doctor pushing patient pipeline instead bothering help waiting long enough help people pretend dont exist also apatheticpredatory relative want person die claim inheritance dont bother anymoreim generally pro physician assisted suicide lot potential issue broad legalization definitely see youve drs dr like years apathy already id totally agree logic think year ago really hurt basically die case friend might end suffering hasnt really changed last year even care inhumane need widely adapted accept safeguard place stop abuse thats one biggest fear might buy people didnt everything extend misery suffering elderly entanglement eugenics medical abuse thats people one decide something goverment promote push anyone everything else fails mean canada isnt using maid order allow terminally ill patient die dignity kill people ethically allowing many condition allow assisted suicide look annual report canada look many individual disability care didnt get small number human gotten care didnt end decided end lifealso disabled folk long long time government actively killing unwanted unfit live useless genetic purity eugenics unworthy life look holocaust america locked away disabled people

could imagine needed insulin said nah dependent euthanize yourselfi think hard complicated topic lot nuance sure hell dont trust government recent current history antagonistic terminally ill chronic pain patient said absolutely everything came say thank even considering opening accessibility maid imperative make sure disabled people care need would actuallybe helpful u whats cheaper government domany disabled people choose maid waiting list longor government simply want pay healthcare wish could upvote well said canada people offered maidbecauseits cheaper province providing housing case read doctor appalled patient housing making sicker choice homeless dying chose dying good situation terminal illnessesthey simply needed healthy place live problem still usually take year get disability benefit afford stay alive address medical need even afford live youre sick doctor still unwilling medicate people need theyre really limiting option putting option table could dangerous vulnerable people tend one fewest option general itd easier costeffective leave disabled people option perspective politician see u burden nothing main argument seen hundred disabled folk follow twitter world yes would question live world access healthcare tied incentive reduce cost idea reducing healthcare cost per patient tempting healthcare system particularly socialized nationalized one u

iknowthis like lottery chance make many crowdfunding post possible various website including reddit reddits recommend checking rule posting anything sometimes get lucky thing go really well live belgium different story also clear rule cannot get process also clearly described law people say people get every year also partially taboo around slowly disappearing people still get palliative sedation lead thing another reason increase people get euthanasia population getting older mean chronically debilitating illness cancersanother thing lot doctor dont like euthanasia action patient take compared palliative sedation doctor basically taking decision sedate someone euthanasia active handeling wish patient administering cocktail medication end life end result patient dead timeframe different also controlled patient process different described law request patient palliative sedation administer physicianto answer question majority people lot people actively well blame medium medium example us belgium law people age request euthanasia performing eugenetics kill sicc people cheaper definitely case much care taken medical team evaluate legal requirement medical requirement euthanasia request opinion good thing good balance check control determine patient fully capable making decision understanding ramification well checking medical need truly therein end suffering always personal feeling experience one know feeling fully understand thought process think people imagine constant excruciating pain get better almost impossible manage would agree another waysorry long ramblings hope little bit informative mistake used speech text apology mistake weird wording interesting thankswith belgium though cant get past fact allowed year old woman take life based mental health issue people routinely learn manage live relatively normal life even take there saying could much better thats heartbreaking make sad know people signed safeguard followed etc year ptsd another know sad great informative thank ive conversation child multiple time quality life right dont whole lot essay unspeakable conversation harriet mcbryde johnson topic first read first chapter disability visibility edited alice wong personally changed mind staunchly pro assisted death think itd worth reading even doesnt change mind think give lot insight people assisted death part healthcare work option eg treatment care financial help fully available assistent death supposed last resort people chance relief sadly isnt case treatment withheld non essential doctor dont take u seriously many u risk poverty homelessness top debilitating symptom dont think people assisted death general society health care system available form assisted death eg maid available instead actual treatment death offered people could helped whose quality life could improved make deeply unethical got sick crpsrsd never considered unaliving ever even would considered selfish however chronic pain make change mind ow realize people sometimes chose end whether struggling pain even mental illness totally dont think selfish anymore trust ive considered bunch nowi never assisted death tho ive always felt like legal everywhere gone suffering pain would understand would make someone get point feel like people playing gd could comment group belief think ill stay soapboxgenerally people pretty supportive folk able say death especially come terminal degenerative conditionsi think folk get concerned story doctor insurance company willing sportive approve assisted death treatment le expensive folk disability turning assisted suicide cant access healthcare treatment housing food thing necessary live slippery slope eugenicsover bluesky there interesting discourse outside ive talked another debate california maid law possible inclusion mental illness permitted diagnosis allow someone choose die brings whole lot concern ill leave dont agree many different reason totally understand reason arei dont think right end someone life whether thats assisted suicide capital punishment murder dont think anyone hand ending somebody el lifei dont think putting someone else position help wise even though choice help doesnt mean arent psychological repercussionsplenty woman freely choose abortion example many still psychological issue following thisi think potentially open abuse though think minimal risk think still therewhat doesnt work happens even state provided lethal injection gone wrong invokes wrong face trauma pushing trauma potentially leaving someone alive worse tan originallyhaving said know flaw thinkingreasoning consequently also part support balance donti suspicious anyone come either side absolute conviction becuse huge topic many nuance anyone imo opinion hasnt thought implication dont think missed finer nuancesso dont agree balance rather absolute ironically agree alot leaning towards againstits something need strict guideline eligible looser restriction get likely issue whether someone mentally ill getting access someone abusing power working correctly etc etc im terminally ill people want quality life sometime able access though imagine alot situation people argue patient mentally ill unable make choice watching parent die dementia within month caregiver im huge proponent euthanasia people havent seen death close personal imo netherlands euthanasia law currently process applying euthanasia always pro euthanasia hate people see suicide simply isnt want live dont want cant live like anymore living immense pain many year inhumane controversy extreme especially country think suffering divinelyinflicted owe god endure every fucking screaming second gifti added paragraph dnr living state opinion national right life pro life community blunt obscene term doctor raised eyebrow said ever come want judge doubt mind want people speaking behalf okay euthanize animalspets humaneyet okay consenting adult make decision consent duress isnt genuine consent ensure lack duressi agree conceptually wanting maximize freedom current lack protection disabled already proof take place ethical way hard yes religion thing seeing people rejectinghelping others reject gift life deitydeities granted pretty much spiting deityies also weird culture death taboo wanting taboo since bad ending associated sadness ive heard people think life better living dying dont realize amount pain someone even consider assisted suicide people live pain understand people dont think get thats gonna okay okay crazy fact legal state im inhowever see many potential problem abuse

husband gave wife suffering painful terminal cancer od kept asking please k he facing jail time treat pet better im okay euthanasia support dignity death choice within reason plenty documented evidence dont know whats even weirder majority people seem supportive animal euthanasia human even someone clearly suffering quality life think people extremely afraid chronic pain chronic condition

delaying inevitable causing terminally ill one unbearable pain body give searing agony month straight youre much pain think suicide mind drawn itthat said logical level still knew living constant pain far better deadlife special rare even worst day gift lack physical suffering always guess ikr government proven abuse refuse treatment wishing continue life matter like doesnt make sense majority

didnt get learn think watching two show many medication create dependency user antidepressant notoriously difficult taper antiseizure med often prescribed chronic pain sufferer often dont help many diabetic dependant insulin sustains life people dependent blood pressure med arent labelled addict using themthe issue oxycontin aggressively marketed doctor nonaddictive often prescribed regularly minor pain ailment people didnt need became addictedthe damage overreaction genuine pain sufferer truly cruel irony genuinely need effective pain relief denied help labelled wrongly addict first paragraph say stigma addiction applied longterm use dependence unhelpful hurtful exactly marketing oxycontin criminal wouldnt put insulin category body longer make insulin someone taking thats reason blood pressure except body trouble pushing blood vessel agree rest agree youve said diabetic require insulin body cant produce thats different kind dependence isnt really comparable opioid
