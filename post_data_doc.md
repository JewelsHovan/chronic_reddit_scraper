He said I should get a nerve block and it will have me feeling like I have a new back for a few hours, then they can burn the nerves. But I just got it done at 9 and I have no relief and the pain of the shot was way worse than the steroid injections. I am still having a lot of pain in the injection site and although I was trying to go today without meds to see if this helped, I caved and had to take a pain pill in order to have basic movement backI have been unable to get out of my bed or bend over since I got home.Has anyone else experienced this? What does it mean other than that it’s obviously not my nerves? I’m super disappointed bc I was looking forward to this “new back” I was promised 😭",
