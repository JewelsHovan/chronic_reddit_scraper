        "text": "One of the biggest and most deadly issues facing us who suffer with chronic pain is mental defeat. The vast, seemingly unending toll the pain takes on our bodies affects the mind. The pain oftentimes will steal things from us as well, activities we used to love, foods we would order in restaurants, not being able to move or travel as we would like, and on and on it can go. This is when we need to connect with others most....and when we feel most isolated. Very, very few in our real, everyday lives have any understanding at all of what we actually go thru, it's why they make stupid comments when we share how we feel, or like we have been stolen from. \"You can still do this, or you can still eat that, or my favorite, it could be worse.\" Comments just like those have led to many a chronic pain sufferer having had enough and choosing to end their lives because they feel like nobody gives a flying F. Chronic Pain Warriors United is going to bring attention to this problem and create a community of individuals living a very shared experience who can connect, help, and support others like us. It is absolutely vital that we do so. Preventing more from taking their own lives is of the highest and most dear priorities.",

I have no friends, and can't find work to save my life. I have been through the medical system so many times, but Im allergic to NSAIDs, and doctors here wont prescribe opiods to the poors. I have been totally abandoned by the medical system, my family do not believe that i am as bad as i am, and are actively trynig to pressure me into occupations that would further damage my spine. I am living on disability, if you can call that living. Im so tired. Im tired of being in pain, of being ignored. im at the point where im actively planning my end at 40, becoz what hope is there for me? (mental health system dont give a shit when i tell them this before anyone suggests i call numbers).  i want to move away but cant possibly afford it. i want to just run to the ends of the earth and just disappear.",

If you treat people with respect you'd be amazed how much they're willing to give in return, or WHAT they can give in return.Most nights, we have at least 2-3 large bags full of bakery items by the trash waiting to be .... well, trashed by someone with a key. I have a key. I hold that shit for the needy.... It's an on-the-side thing. I see SAFE shit about to be thrown and I recover it for someon ewho needs it NOW.

    "content": "Back in 2019, I was in a horrible car accident. It was a head-on collision with a semi truck. I broke both of my legs; my right ankle was crushed into 20 pieces and all of the cartilage was obliterated. I‚Äôve had one surgery on my left leg, and I‚Äôve had two surgeries as well as PRP injections and stem cell injections for my right ankle. I‚Äôve been told by multiple orthopedic ankle specialists that the only viable option for my condition is to have an ankle fusion. My right leg is 1/4 inch shorter‚Äî I have to wear an insert in that shoe and exclusively have to wear tennis shoes. My ankle does not have any range of motion. I will never be able to jump or run again, and I limp quite a bit when the arthritis is flaring up, mornings, and all the typical arthritis points of pain. This happened when I was 21 in 2019. I was able to return to life in July 2021 where I got my bachelors degree with honors and I have been steadily working since.So it‚Äôs safe to say that I am very good at putting on a brave face as most people I know have no clue what I‚Äôve been through. However, I feel frustrated when it comes to my spouse because I‚Äôve explained as well as I can how I feel. How it‚Äôs not just my ankle‚Äî it‚Äôs my hips, back, neck, shoulders, and mental hell. My husband is a great person and he would never discount my feelings. But I KNOW that if he could experience what it feels like to be in my body for just ONE day, he would understand.Does anyone have any advice on how to navigate this? I can‚Äôt keep going the way I am without seriously reinjuring myself, and I feel trapped in my own mental hell because I feel like no one understands. I feel like, as a 26 year old, I‚Äôm expected to just be grateful that I didn‚Äôt lose my legs or die‚Äî then put my head down and work like a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù 26 year old. When in reality, I want to cry everyday because I feel so trapped in my body.",

A comment on the first video from Brisummer1 was what got me to do this one last night. She was being treated by her primary care Dr for chronic pain, he/she is retiring, and the new Dr does not want to continue the pain medication that gives her a higher quality of life. This is so heartbreaking. So wrong. She is scared, of course, and doesn't know what to do. I was shocked her pgp was still doing it, almost all quit. My grandmother's included. Smh. Did it happen to you or a loved one? Both?https://youtu.be/pAIaNA6fLR8?si=mu1KT59fuxqNLWZn",

I say many, most, a lot, because there is almost never all of anything, but I've spent a lot of time talking with people from the EU about this, and they hate the system. Of course, in a couple of countries, they won't treat pain management properly, but they will give heroin/Dilaudid/pharmaceutical opium to the \"addicts\" for free. Don't want to go too deep into the weeds, I think the latter is prob the best way to deal with that issue, but you have understanding and compassion for one group of people's pain and struggles, while ignoring the others.

        "text": "You're going to be sorry you asked because my story is long. My PCP was audited by the DEA and lost his license to prescribe. He told me he had 11 patients on narcotics & the DEA had issues with all of them. I asked what their problem with me was, and he said I canceled appointments on the same day. First of all, sometimes I'm in no shape to drive & my husband was still working, so not available. Secondly, I asked for the dates I canceled and it was a couple of acupuncture appointments, not medication management. He also was starting to buy into the hyperalgesia crap, which I think is true of some people, but he was being taught it was everyone on opioids.I saw a new doctor who lied outright to me several times. She decided she was sending me to rehab because I missed 2 appointments in a row. The first was a snowstorm & I didn't cancel, she did. The second was 2 days after my mother died unexpectedly (she was 92, not a huge shock) and I was dealing with notifying people and her funeral. I caught a norovirus at the funeral so I was back in that doctor's office 10 days after the missed appointment. She misdiagnosed the norovirus. She said I had a cough & the other symptoms were just me being oversensitive. I found out from other people who caught it at the funeral that it was norovirus. She told me at that appointment she was referring me to rehab.I had looked for pain management prior to this & could only find offices that dealt with rheumatoid arthritis or spinal issues, but this time I found one that would take me. I also switched PCPs to one that wasn't outright nasty to me & a liar. I've been in pain management for almost 10 years now. My meds were reduced to 90 mme about 6 years ago, a year after they said I had to choose between Ativan & opioids. I chose opioids & I really miss the Ativan. I moved to Delaware and part of the attraction was, they had the same medical marijuana laws as RI. At my first PCP appointment, I found out doctors in Delaware do not like you using medical marijuana & opioids, you have to choose. It took me 9 months to find pain management so I was driving back to RI every month. Now I have to drive an hour each way to an office in Maryland where they are fine with MMJ with opioids. They were going to fill out my application for me but couldn't because I'm not a Maryland resident.The doctor who runs the place cut me from 90mme to 60mme because, he said, people over 60 can develop liver issues (I get tested twice a year, no liver issues)so we needed to cut my meds by a third. My questioning why we're reducing an arbitrary amount to a lower arbitrary amount got me nowhere.After all that, I caught my teen grandson stealing my MMJ so I stopped using it for the most part. I'll vape here and there but that's all.",

        "text": "My primary was awesome. Made all my referrals ordered scans and tests. I was in his office crying from pain the LDN didn‚Äôt work I was barely mobile I was a mess. He put me on pain meds and sent me to a pain clinic. A year later he left the clinic and moved to another state. The replacement I got immediately started with, let‚Äôs see what meds we can take you off of cause your on too many. Half are mental health meds. So I asked to be taken off lyrica I had been on it 16 years and it wasn‚Äôt working. That was okay for me. Then I was told I wouldn‚Äôt get my pain meds refilled so I tapered myself off. I called in and needed a new refill for my muscle relaxers, I was told I no longer needed them and he was cutting me off and I needed to make another appointment to discuss my meds. I immediately switched clinics that same day I had an appointment with a new primary in a couple days. I came in and she said I won‚Äôt prescribe your oxycodone but I will prescribe your muscle relaxers. My pain clinic at the time didn‚Äôt prescribe painkillers either so I‚Äôve been off them for a while. I had a great pain Dr at the time and he was trying injections at the time and then he quit the clinic. The new guy i got redid my tests. I have a new diagnosis but he refused to treat telling me it‚Äôs normal wear and tear and there‚Äôs no inflammation but inflammation is stated in the radiologist report. It‚Äôs facet joint hypertrophy in all my lower lumbar. I‚Äôm seeing a new back specialist at a new clinic next week.",

Are all of these same standards going to be applied to them when they get an injury, disorders, disease, or whatever else that causes chronic pain? I know a couple personally who actually have had to deal with the system. The cognitive dissonance when they complained about it was massively obvious. I am an extremely empathetic person with a strong sense of justice, not just right and wrong. And that felt almost like justice to me. I know they turned away enormous #s of people seeking pain management before they could ever even get thru the doors of the two clinics they worked at. Two guys, two clinics, two different states, doing the same things to human beings every day. Smh.. I can't imagine doing that job.",

        "text": "Happened to me as soon as I change to SSI because I went bankrupt from specialists and became very disabled yes they separate you from your primary care doctor they don't let the primary care doctor prescribe pain medicine even if they want to. Most of them don't want to won't even consider it. I was fortunate for many many years and functional with my primary care doctor prescribing the medicine and monitoring it carefully. With this new situation and SSI primary care doctor doesn't monitor anything I haven't seen my primary care doctor in what 3 months because of the hacking and it's even worse because generally it's hard to get in even though I'm flat on my back have diabetes my blood pressure went so high 197 over about 106 everybody said go to the hospital the hospital's closed down pih don't think is opening back up. The pharmacy won't fill anything unless it's a written prescription and I'm worried about paying meds because PIH will not answer their phones for anything they won't use cell phones which something they could do they could give a cell phone to each department right now but they refuse to do that so the pharmacy can't contact any doctors about any medicine or any prescriptions. And primary care doctors no way they are not going to prescribe pain medicine now. It's like the insurance company might be doing it on purpose I haven't read your link yet but I will if you could make it so the links can be transferred to like storage place because otherwise there's no proof to send it to anybody.

It is a damning indictment of the whole system, and it is something that we working together in #s can and will, absolutely change. No patient should EVER have been cut off from their primary Dr against their will. I can't believe that it was allowed by the medical profession. Now, we have to take our medical rights back and get government agent men out from between people's Dr's and healthcare. It is morally abhorrent, and it has to stop.",

I‚Äôm hoping someone might be able to relate to what I‚Äôm describing and help translate it in a way to what a doctor might understand better.The pain: it‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm bound up in tight bandages over my whole body. It‚Äôs worst around my midsection and legs, it feels like there‚Äôs this phantom ‚Äòbandage‚Äô that‚Äôs holding me together and if it disappeared my body would just collapse. I have to think about my posture and how I‚Äôm holding my limbs up to minimise the pain. The closest I can come up with is ‚Äòache‚Äô and ‚Äòpressure‚Äô but I don‚Äôt feel like that totally accurately describes how painful it is.Any thoughts at all are greatly appreciated, thanks  :)",

        "text": "Try keeping a pain journal for a while, it IS difficult to explain pain to anyone. But practice will make it easier.You may want to consider a sphygmomanometer (blood pressure checker thing) so you can track your vitals a bit deeper. Im sure you have a thermometer..If not Dollar Tree should have them, for a buck. But definitely get in the habit of checking your BP. especially if it turns out to be high, like Im thinking. Any swelling in the legs?There's a thing MS patients experience called the MS Hug. The medical term is dysesthesia. Its supposed to feel like your body is in one of those blood pressure cuffs and they keep pumping it tight. Dont get real excited over this, it could be just about anything at this point. You should be able to rule it in or out with a brain MRI.One thing I would suggest about describing your pain, is dont get too hung up on the 1-10 pain scale. Doctors ask this out of tradition more than usefulness. Whats a \"7\" pain? Ill bet you $100 its not the same as MY \"7\" pain. So its more a question of \"how are you doing?\" than anything helpful diagnostically. When you need to get across the severity of the pain, docs use mild moderate and severe. Thats it. No \"9.7543\" on their pain scale. And if you go in and say your pain is a \"12\",  remember the movie Spinal Tap and how it was so funny explaining the had an amp that went to 11? It was funny cause it was silly. The exam room is no place for silly stuff. Your pain is severe. If you want to toss in an unbearable, that works. Its a lot easier to describe the pain severity if you ignore than damned 1-10 scale.Dont worry too much about giving a right or wrong answer. If you feel it, its right. Best of luck....",

Just try to balance the full-time job in school so the bills don't get you you don't get suddenly to disable and you end up on SSI also make sure your job's full time so you got benefits so that when you file it'll be SSD your coverage will be better you won't get sent to people that don't care you won't lose your policy like I did I didn't know there was a five-year limit and the time I wasn't fully working it was bad it hit me fast I last a long time though I went to school like you got my masters my doctorate and that's where sorry hit me bad had about 2 years there was no jobs and then after that the pain was so bad I couldn't take the jobs I was offered mine was bad luck there was no jobs after I graduated but that might not be your case but I'm telling you be careful of it hit and hard and suddenly you can't work and when that happens file right away I lost what I could have had was good treatment because I didn't know the file right away I kept thinking I was going to get better and $ kept going out. So I'm here to tell you there is hope you're not at the end of the tunnel okay you're still working you're at the beginning of the tunnel. I'm giving you future advice and I'm going to keep doing it for you guys are working and you're fighting the pain and you don't think you're winning you are you're still working just don't cut down to half Time or anything that affects your SSD find out what will affect you if you go on SSD or will keep you from doing that. Don't be naive like I was don't let the pain make the days pass so fast that you don't know you've passed a deadline for your future care. Start making plans. Don't let people tell you it's going to get better if you're lucky it will but if you're not it won't and you got to make plans for that. Because you can't rely  on anyone. No one. Even family members will in some cases have been people I've seen it I've had it happen to me. What you doing is great keep on. Just start making some plans calling social security finding out how many units you have find out what your benefits are find if they are applicable if you suddenly become disabled what happens you can't go back to work what happens what might you get for income for insurance for medical care all those things that I didn't do you're in danger of. I hope I've helped one person if they read this. Godspeed and prayers. Hugs to you because I know you need it.",

He is kind and caring but always forgets that I often can‚Äôt do anything but exist.After anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, I finally resign myself to taking pain medication and maybe my other meds, too. Often, though, I just focus on the pain meds, telling myself I‚Äôll take the rest once I‚Äôve taken the edge off my pain.And that‚Äôs all my pain meds do these days, take the edge off just enough to pull me back from the ledge.Before I went on LTD and eventually got SSDI, my days were similar to OP foryearsexcept that I didn‚Äôt work from home until the last six months before I had to leave the workforce permanently. I know from experience, though, there is NOTHING more exhausting than wearing the brave mask of normalcy for work/school/family/life while dealing with crippling pain so severe it‚Äôd send most people to urgent care.It‚Äôs exhausting being us, no doubt.

And now because I'm on Medicaid the one Medicaid facility in my area has been hacked so I can't even get a call to a doctor. If I'm lucky my meds will go through if I'm not I'm screwed. And since there's no computers working no phones working for the facility and all the doctors I'm screwed. So I can't even beg for help. So what you do is you write down whenever you take your meds. Figure what's happening is you're taking too many then when you go and you take the regular amount you're going through depression withdrawal. Not to mention the fact that you don't sleep. I'm on the high blood pressure medicine clonidine I was just put on it because I was almost dead 191 systolic daily it is knocking me out if I don't take it when I'm supposed to I get a headache I still have a headache now because I tried to push it 3 hours so I could stay awake. I have no freaking support I'm being audited still by SSI I can't find an attorney for that and I really need one I cannot make many calls because I'm so sedated from blood pressure medicine and that doesn't do anything for the pain it just makes me so sedated that my visions blurred I can't talk very well I'm so tired sorry that was actually a yawn with that. Also causes the pain to get worse in certain areas. No there's no other medicine I can take. And I can't get advice from my car they all just because naturally some jerk had to hack it and make it so that medical people couldn't even get in touch with the patients and the patients couldn't get in touch with the medical people. No hospitals no er's. And there's three in the local area. And so they did this not to PIH they did it to the clients. . Doesn't care if the clients can't get a hold of the doctors so why would somebody hack them and ask for a ransom. . Just never going to pay a ransom clients are suffering. Especially if you're disabled in a mobile you're vastly suffering. Yes this sucks you're right it sucks but it gets worse if you don't keep doing what you're doing. end up where I am??",

You have hope that's when you stop working or can't work that you have no hope no support isolation and ultimately just wait for death. But if you're working even a little bit in front of a screen in which there is money coming in we've grown to association that's success. I know you hate the idea that you got up you hate the idea that you didn't sleep all night you hate the idea that you've got to take another pill that probably doesn't work very well and if it worked well you'd sleep at night. Think you're at the level though that you can still do stuff behaviorally have an air bed. Unless you got spinal problems and airbed helps a lot. Riding down when you take the medicine helps so that there is actually that level in your body because if you end up on SSI they're going to not give you medicine and before they do that if you go to pain management doctor they're going to make you urinate into a cup and if you're taking too much they're going to get rid of you so write it down what you take the time you take it put a big clock a pair of paper that has a date on the clock write it down have a bunch of pens just right there every time you take it beside your bed if you have to write it down don't swallow it without writing it down 10 in one hand pill on the other I mean literally. Been where you are. I'm sorry it is so bad. Don't know what you're taking. But pain medicine never did that to me but I am enlightened now and the last week or so being on this clonidine for blood pressure but sincerely is dope me up more than any narcotic I have ever imagined except it doesn't relieve pain so I got to write everything down now too or I don't even know what I took. So I cuz miserate with you my friend and my phone won't write properly so I am so sorry. Why cuz clonidine makes your throat so dry that the phone can't hear you right and I have an accent. And I don't know how long I'll be stoned and clonidine and I've got court to go to. I can't find a free pro bowl lawyer for social security no can't find it for you all year none of them do what's called reevaluation or AUDIT for SSI. The places that did don't need more because they're financially broke and don't have the staff I've been told today three times. So my day really sucked too I'm sorry I got out of the bed also really regret it. Actually I have just a couch. I'm hungry but I didn't do any shopping and I don't even think I could get to the kitchen at this point. So I'm going to sign off with I understand how you feel but you're not at the end of the tunnel it can get a lot worse for those that don't want it to get worse trust me do some of the things I recommend stay employed right everything down. Timeless medications so they hit you mostly at night not during the day if you can. That's if you can bear the pain long enough. Unfortunately in my situation I have to take this every 12 hours pass out for 6 to 8 hours I'm a total zombie and it's just blood pressure medication and I have severe pain issues that doesn't even help the pain but not me into a zombie with pain. And there's absolutely no support. I might as well be talking to the wall. And it's dirty so I don't want to talk to it. Sorry that you're in the situation trust me get it scheduled if you have to put a clock everywhere that pallet paper right by your medicine you don't touch that medicine until you have the pen in one hand the pill on the other when it's written down you can take the medicine stick it in your mouth real fast. Not until it's written down. Keep track of the meds try to make them at night or towards the time of closing of business if you're working. Learn how long it takes the meds to affect you. It takes an hour before you start losing it. Take an hour before you have to check out of your work computer. Give a bottle of water near the pad. Oh as far as the dogs go time to get auto feed. Time to get all the water. And time to get a collar reacting doggie door. Make sure they don't get your meds. Those things help a lot. I hope this helps you in some way and a lot of us understand how you feel. So sorry. I am trying will take ideas if anybody has them.",

Music saved me, I would play 3-4 gigs a month with different bands and it gave me something to live for. During this time I bought a Jaco Pastorius shirt for gigs (brilliant bassist) and it was snug to put it lightly. I wore under a jacket for one gig and filed it away in my closet. I tried exercise post injury but was intimidated by the gym and actually discouraged by the able bodied because \"they saw no point\". During the pandemic I got into watching gym content and this wrestling content creator (Simon Miller) would always say \"The gym is for everybody\" so I bought a couple dumbbells and started small. No goals but just to be active, no weightloss pressure or nothing. Three years later I'm settled into a 6 day a week program tailored to my disability and I'm wearing the shirt comfortably. We make the able bodied uncomfortable because we could easily be them.

I hate it!  I still try occasionally, but the driving is what stops me every time.  The twisting to look behind at my blind spot, the gas and brake makes my back hurt from lifting and pushing with my \"bad\" leg.  I have drop foot on the left so it make it hard and I have to use mostly my hip to lift that leg and my thigh to \"push\" the gas/brakes.  Then there's the sitting in one position for any length of time.  Then, of course, the bumps and dips in the road.  Steering is hard because it pulls on my back as well.I don't want to give up driving, but it's looking bad for me.  In a few years I will probably have no choice.",

Then, there is the grandson. Take him to school, pick him up. I'm the only one in the house that cleans, and there are two other people in the two bedrooms on the main floor. Even my daughter has stopped doing anything around the house. Her daddy got a job working with her, he lives with our oldest and her kiddo. So that has lessened the mileage on the car. Save this week. Their is down, am hoping that gear shift thingy just popped out. Trying to find a cheap mechanic on marketplace is annoying. Over half are scammers. So, now I'm driving them all to work and school. Even when my leg goes numb. Or, I don't even want to wear a shirt, much less get fully dressed. And I hate driving in the dark when it's raining.
